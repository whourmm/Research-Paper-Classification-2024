Childhood Trauma and Childhood Mental Disorder in Military and Employed Civilian Men(Article),"['Syed Sheriff, R.', 'Van Hooff, M.', 'Malhi, G.', 'Grace, B.', 'McFarlane, A.']","Volume 208, Issue 1, 1 January 2020, Pages 13-20","We aimed to retrospectively investigate childhood trauma and childhood mental disorder in military and employed civilian men aged 18 to 54 years. Data, derived from the 2010 Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study and the 2007 Australian Bureau of Statistics National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing Study, were analyzed and compared using direct age standardization and logistic regression. A greater proportion of ADF reported childhood trauma, multiple trauma types, trauma onset below 12 years of age, and interpersonal trauma than civilian employed men. A greater proportion of ADF reported childhood noninterpersonal trauma, such as accidents, than civilian employed men, with a marked difference in those aged 45 to 54 years. In both populations, childhood disorder was associated with childhood trauma; however, childhood depression was not associated with childhood noninterpersonal trauma in either population. A deeper understanding of the longer-term risk and resilience conferred by different childhood trauma profiles is needed. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells caused by overexpression of translation elongation factor P in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942(Article),"['Ngoennet, S.', 'Sirisattha, S.', 'Honda, M.', 'Hibino, T.', 'Kageyama, H.', 'Waditee-Sirisattha, R.']","Volume 104, Issue 20, 1 October 2020, Pages 8801-8812","Abstract: Translation elongation factors (EFs) are proteins that play important roles during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. In prokaryotes, at least four EFs function in repetitive reactions (EF-Tu, EF-Ts, EF-G, and EF-P). EF-P plays a vital role in the specialized translation of consecutive proline amino acid motifs. It was also recently recognized that EF-P acts throughout translation elongation. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that cell division and morphology are intimately linked to the control of EF-P in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. We constructed the overexpression of a wild-type gene product for EF-P (Synpcc7942_2565) as a tool to identify EF-P functionality. The overexpression of EF-P resulted in the morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells. During the stationary phase, EF-P overexpressors displayed cell lengths of 150 μm or longer, approximately 35 times longer than the control. Total cellular protein and amino acid content were also increased in overexpressors. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperelongation, gene expression analysis was performed. The results revealed that cell division genes, including ftn6, minD, mreB, mreC, and ftsZ, were modulated in overexpressors. Strikingly, ftn6 was severely down-regulated. Little is known regarding EF-P in prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms. Our results suggest that cyanobacterial EF-P participates in the acceleration of protein synthesis and also regulates cell division processes. These findings suggest new ways to modify translation and metabolism in cyanobacteria. Phenotypic and metabolic alterations caused by overexpressing EF-P may also be beneficial for applications such as low-cost, green molecular factories. Key points: • Cell division and cell morphology in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 are closely linked with the control of translation elongation factor P (EF-P). • Overexpression of EF-P leads to morphological plasticity in hyperelongated cells. • Cyanobacterial EF-P is involved in the acceleration of protein synthesis and the regulation of cell division processes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,"{'ISSN': '01757598', 'Source Type': 'AMBID', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s00253-020-10874-8', 'Publisher': '32915258'}","['Cyanobacteria', 'Elongation factor P', 'Hyperelongation', 'Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942', 'Amino acids', 'Biosynthesis', 'Cell proliferation', 'Elongation', 'Gene expression', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Proteins', 'Cell division process', 'Cellular proteins', 'Gene expression analysis', 'Molecular mechanism', 'Photosynthetic organisms', 'Protein synthesis', 'Synechococcus elongatus', 'Translation elongation', 'Cytology', 'amino acid', 'cell protein', 'elongation factor', 'elongation factor P', 'FtsZ protein', 'MreB protein', 'unclassified drug', 'elongation factor', 'factor EF-P', 'amino acid', 'cell component', 'cyanobacterium', 'gene expression', 'metabolism', 'morphology', 'phenotype', 'prokaryote', 'protein', 'Article', 'bacterial gene', 'bacterial metabolism', 'cell division', 'cell plasticity', 'ftn6 gene', 'gene expression', 'gene overexpression', 'gene product', 'minD gene', 'mreC gene', 'nonhuman', 'phenotype', 'protein synthesis', 'Synechococcus elongatus', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'protein motif', 'Synechococcus', 'Cyanobacteria', 'Prokaryota', 'Synechococcus elongatus', 'Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Peptide Elongation Factors', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Synechococcus']","['aDepartment of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bThe Chemical Approaches for Food Applications Research Group, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cInstitute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani, 12120, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Meijo University, Nagoya, Aichi  468-8502, Japan', 'eGraduate School of Environmental and Human Sciences, Meijo University, Nagoya, Aichi  468-8502, Japan']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Institute for Fermentation, Osaka', 'Funding Number': 'G-2019-3-002', 'Acronym': 'IFO'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation', 'Funding Number': 'R2-185', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'School of Aerospace Science and Technology', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'SAST'}]"
