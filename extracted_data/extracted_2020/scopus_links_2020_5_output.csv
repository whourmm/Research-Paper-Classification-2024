Automated Firearm Classification from Bullet Markings Using Deep Learning(Article)(Open Access),"['Pisantanaroj, P.', 'Tanpisuth, P.', 'Sinchavanwat, P.', 'Phasuk, S.', 'Phienphanich, P.', 'Jangtawee, P.', 'Yakoompai, K.', 'Donphoongpi, M.', 'Ekgasit, S.', 'Tantibundhit, C.']","Volume 8, 2020, Article number 9076037, Pages 78236-78251","Firearm violence is one of the leading causes of death in many countries around the world, including Thailand. This work proposes a fast and accurate automated method to classify firearm brands from bullet markings. Specifically, a panoramic image of a bullet collected from a crime scene was captured using a developed mobile phone application and custom-built portable hardware. The top three state-of-the-art CNNs pretrained on ImageNet - DenseNet121, ResNet50, and Xception - were further trained on the same training set, which was composed of 718 bullets collected from eight different firearm brands - Beretta, Browning, CZ, Glock, Norinco, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Smith Wesson - using a five-fold cross validation technique. DenseNet121 provided the highest AUC of 0.99 for CZ classification (the most common registered firearm brand in Thailand) and the highest average AUC for the eight firearm brands (0.9780 ± 0.0130 SD), which was significantly higher than those of ResNet50 and Xception. In addition, there were no interaction effects between the CNN model and firearm brand on AUC. DenseNet121, which had the highest AUC, was evaluated on the test set (72 bullets), and the results showed that the Beretta and CZ classifications had the lowest accuracy (91.18%), followed by the Browning and Norinco classifications (96.88%), whereas the Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Smith Wesson classifications had the highest accuracy (98.41%). These results suggest that the developed mobile phone application based on a deep learning algorithm and the custom-built portable hardware have promising potential for use at crime scenes to classify firearms from bullet markings. By narrowing down the list of suspects, this convenient approach can potentially accelerate bullet identification processes for many forensic science examiners. © 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Access,"{'ISSN': '21693536', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989673', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['9 mm bullet marking', 'automated firearm classification', 'densely connected convolutional network', 'Forensic science', 'Cellular telephones', 'Classification (of information)', 'Crime', 'E-learning', 'Learning algorithms', 'Portable equipment', 'Automated methods', 'Cross-validation technique', 'Firearm violence', 'Identification process', 'Interaction effect', 'Mobile phone applications', 'Panoramic images', 'State of the art', 'Deep learning']","['aCenter of Excellence in Intelligent Informatics, Speech and Language Technology and Service Innovation (CILS), Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus, Pathum Thani, 12120, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Thammasat University, Khlong Nueng, 12120, Thailand', 'cRuamrudee International School, Bangkok, 10510, Thailand', 'dSensor Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eFirearms and Ammunition Subdivision, Central Police Forensic Science Division, Bangkok, 10830, Thailand', 'fProfessional Level Firearm and Physical Evidence Examination Section, Ministry of Justice, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand']",[]

Influence of the spatial variability of hydraulic parameters on rainfall-induced landslides(Conference Paper),"['Nguyen, T.S.', 'Likitlersuang, S.']",2020,"The effect of rainfall-induced landslides is usually characterised by hydraulic parameters of soil such as saturated permeability (ks) and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC). The main objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of spatial variability of hydraulic parameters on slope stability of unsaturated soil during rainfall infiltration. The spatial variability of ksand van Genuchten parameters (a, n) are simulated by random field theory using the Cholesky decomposition technique. An infinite unsaturated soil slope model is employed for stability analysis. A transient seepage analysis is conducted by random finite element method (RFEM) to obtain the pore water pressure distribution. Next, a stability analysis is performed to indicate the failure mechanism of slope. A numerical procedure for a probabilistic analysis of slope is performed based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the failure probability of slope is highly influenced by the spatial variability of SWCC.

Contralateral Mueller’s muscle-conjunctiva resection: a therapeutic option in thyroid eye disease patients with unilateral eyelid retraction(Article),"['Saonanon, P.', 'Potita, P.']","Volume 39, Issue 2, 3 March 2020, Pages 98-101","Purpose: To evaluate pre- and post-operative marginal reflex distance 1 (MRD1) when conducting Mueller’s muscle-conjunctiva resection (MMCR) on the normal eyelid of thyroid eye disease (TED) patients with unilateral eyelid retraction. Methods: This was a retrospective non-comparative case series. Medical records of TED patients with unilateral eyelid retraction, who underwent a contralateral MMCR from November 2015 to September 2017, were reviewed. Standard photographs of pre-operative, post-phenylephrine test and post-operative were measured for eyelid positions including MRD1, MRD2 and inter-palpebral fissure width. MMCR was indicated on the contralateral eyelid only in patients who had a cosmetically acceptable result from phenylephrine test and were willing to receive the operation on the normal eye. Results: Twelve TED patients who underwent MMCR on the normal eyelid were included in the study. Mean pre-operative MRD1 of retracted and normal eyelid were 5.7 mm (SD = 0.86) and 3.5 mm (SD = 0.65), respectively. Mean post-operative MRD1 of retracted and normal eyelid were 4.4 mm (SD = 0.76) and 4.1 mm (SD = 0.46), respectively. The asymmetry of MRD1 between eyes was significantly decreased from 2.1 mm (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 1.5–2.9 mm) pre-operatively to 0.3 mm (IQR = 0.1–0.7 mm) post-operatively (p =.002). None of these patients needed further eyelid correction surgery and there was no complication. Conclusions: In TED patients with unilateral eyelid retraction, using phenylephrine test on their normal eyes should be initiated. If eyelid position was satisfactorily equalized, performing MMCR on the normal eyelid is considered an effective alternative treatment with a predictable outcome. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Orbit (London),"{'ISSN': '01676830', 'Source Type': 'ORBTD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1080/01676830.2019.1619184', 'Publisher': '31162982'}","['Eyelid retraction', 'Hering’s phenomenon', 'marginal reflex distance', 'Mueller’s muscle-conjunctiva resection', 'phenylephrine test', 'thyroid eye disease', 'dexamethasone plus tobramycin', 'phenylephrine', 'adult', 'Article', 'case control study', 'clinical article', 'contralateral mueller muscle conjunctiva resection', 'disease severity', 'endocrine ophthalmopathy', 'eyelid', 'eyelid reconstruction', 'eyelid retraction', 'female', 'follow up', 'Graves disease', 'human', 'male', 'middle aged', 'preoperative care', 'retrospective study', 'surgical technique', 'treatment duration', 'young adult', 'conjunctiva', 'endocrine ophthalmopathy', 'extraocular muscle', 'eyelid disease', 'eyelid reconstruction', 'procedures', 'Adult', 'Blepharoplasty', 'Conjunctiva', 'Eyelid Diseases', 'Female', 'Graves Ophthalmopathy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oculomotor Muscles', 'Retrospective Studies']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, The Thai Red Cross Society, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]
The Microbiota-Gut-Immune-Glia (MGIG) Axis in Major Depression(Review),"['Rudzki, L.', 'Maes, M.']","Volume 57, Issue 10, 1 October 2020, Pages 4269-4295","There is robust evidence that major depression (MDD) is accompanied by a low-grade activation of the immune-inflammatory response system, which is involved in the pathophysiology of this disorder. It is also becoming apparent that glia cells are in reciprocal communication with neurons, orchestrate various neuromodulatory, homeostatic, metabolic, and immune mechanisms, and have a crucial role in neuroinflammatory mechanisms in MDD. Those cells mediate the central nervous system (CNS) response to systemic inflammation and psychological stress, but at the same time, they may be an origin of the inflammatory response in the CNS. The sources of activation of the inflammatory response in MDD are immense; however, in recent years, it is becoming increasingly evident that the gastrointestinal tract with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and increased intestinal permeability to bacterial LPS and food-derived antigens contribute to activation of low-grade inflammatory response with subsequent psychiatric manifestations. Furthermore, an excessive permeability to gut-derived antigenic material may lead to subsequent autoimmunities which are also known to be comorbid with MDD. In this review, we discuss fascinating interactions between the gastrointestinal tract, increased intestinal permeability, intestinal microbiota, and glia-neuron cross talk, and their roles in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory hypothesis of MDD. To emphasize those crucial intercommunications for the brain functions, we propose the term of microbiota-gut-immune-glia (MGIG) axis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Molecular Neurobiology,"{'ISSN': '08937648', 'Source Type': 'MONBE', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s12035-020-01961-y', 'Publisher': '32700250'}","['Astrocytes', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cytokines', 'Depression', 'Glia', 'Leaky gut', 'LPS', 'Microbiota', 'Microglia', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Oxidative stress', 'aromatic hydrocarbon receptor', 'kynurenine', 'serotonin', 'toll like receptor 4', 'autoimmunity', 'blood brain barrier', 'cell function', 'cell interaction', 'cell maturation', 'degenerative disease', 'evidence based medicine', 'glia', 'human', 'intestine flora', 'intestine mucosa permeability', 'major depression', 'medical parameters', 'mental stress', 'microbiota gut immune glia axis', 'myelination', 'nonhuman', 'oligodendroglia', 'pathogenesis', 'protein expression', 'Review', 'symptom', 'animal', 'immunology', 'major depression', 'microbiology', 'nerve cell', 'pathology', 'Animals', 'Autoimmunity', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons']","['aThe Charleston Centre, 49 Neilston Road, Paisley, PA2 6LY, United Kingdom', 'bDepartment of Psychiatry, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland', 'cDepartment of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Psychiatry, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'eIMPACT Strategic Research Center, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia']",[]

Then, the UV-vis spectrometry and transmission emission microscopy were used to follow the reaction forming AgNP and the optimum reaction time was found at about 20 minutes. The latex mixing of NR and CNT-AgNP hybrid filler was eventually performed. It was also found that the CNT-AgNP hybrid filler enhanced various properties of the NR composites, including torque difference, storage modulus, and initial modulus (from temperature scanning stress relaxation test) as compared to the conventional NR-CNT composite. Furthermore, higher electrical conductivity with comparatively low percolation threshold of the hybrid composites was found as compared to the NR-CNT composite. This might be due to decoration of AgNP particles on CNT surfaces or between CNT bundles caused hindering CNT agglomeration and facilitating electron tunneling. Also, CNT network formation the NR hybrid composite was stronger than in the NR-CNT composite. Furthermore, strong infinite CNT network formation increased thermal diffusion in the NR-CNT/AgNP hybrid composite. © 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers",Polymer Composites,"{'ISSN': '02728397', 'Source Type': 'PCOMD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1002/pc.25378', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['carbon nanotubes', 'electrical properties', 'nanocomposites', 'silver nanoparticle', 'Electric properties', 'Electron tunneling', 'Fillers', 'Metal nanoparticles', 'Nanocomposites', 'Rubber', 'Silver nanoparticles', 'Sodium compounds', 'Solvents', 'Stress relaxation', 'Testing', 'Electrical conductivity', 'Emission microscopy', 'Hybrid composites', 'Natural rubber composites', 'Optimum reaction', 'Percolation thresholds', 'Temperature scanning stress relaxations', 'UV-Vis spectrometry', 'Carbon nanotubes']","['aFaculty of Science and Industrial Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Surat Thani Campus, Surat Thani, Thailand', 'bFaculty of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany', 'cFaculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'PHD/0209/2557', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Prince of Songkla University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'PSU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Rubber Research and Development Institute', 'Funding Number': 'DPG6080001,SIT591146S', 'Acronym': ''}]"
Host proteome linked to HPV E7-mediated specific gene hypermethylation in cancer pathways(Article)(Open Access),"['Na Rangsee, N.', 'Yanatatsaneejit, P.', 'Pisitkun, T.', 'Somparn, P.', 'Jintaridth, P.', 'Topanurak, S.']","Volume 15, Issue 1, 3 February 2020, Article number 7","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes around 90% of cervical cancer cases, and cervical cancer is a leading cause of female mortality worldwide. HPV-derived oncoprotein E7 participates in cervical carcinogenesis by inducing aberrant host DNA methylation. However, the targeting specificity of E7 methylation of host genes is not fully understood but is important in the down-regulation of crucial proteins of the hallmark cancer pathways. In this study, we aim to link E7-driven aberrations in the host proteome to corresponding gene promoter hypermethylation events in the hope of providing novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers to indicate the progression of cervical cancer. Methods: HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-E7 plasmid and empty vector and subjected to mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Down-regulated proteins (where relative abundance was determined significant by paired T-test) relevant to cancer pathways were selected as gene candidates for mRNA transcript abundance measurement by qPCR and expression compared with that in SiHa cells (HPV type 16 positive). Methylation Specific PCR was used to determine promoter hypermethylation in genes downregulated in both SiHa and transfected HEK293 cell lines. The FunRich and STRING databases were used for identification of potential regulatory transcription factors and the proteins interacting with transcription factor gene candidates, respectively. Results: Approximately 400 proteins totally were identified in proteomics analysis. The transcripts of six genes involved in the host immune response and cell proliferation (PTMS, C1QBP, BCAP31, CDKN2A, ZMYM6 and HIST1H1D) were down-regulated, corresponding to proteomic results. Methylation assays showed four gene promoters (PTMS, C1QBP, BCAP31 and CDKN2A) were hypermethylated with 61, 55.5, 70 and 78% increased methylation, respectively. Those four genes can be regulated by the GA-binding protein alpha chain, specificity protein 1 and ETS-like protein-1 transcription factors, as identified from FunRich database predictions. Conclusions: HPV E7 altered the HEK293 proteome, particularly with respect to proteins involved in cell proliferation and host immunity. Down-regulation of these proteins appears to be partly mediated via host DNA methylation. E7 possibly complexes with the transcription factors of its targeting genes and DNMT1, allowing methylation of specific target gene promoters. © 2020 The Author(s).",Infectious Agents and Cancer,"{'ISSN': '17509378', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1186/s13027-020-0271-4', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Cervical cancer', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Human papilloma virus', 'Proteomics', 'Viral oncoproteins', 'B lymphocyte receptor', 'biological marker', 'complement component C1q', 'cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A', 'GA binding protein', 'histone H1', 'messenger RNA', 'parathymosin', 'protein E7', 'proteome', 'transcription factor Sp1', 'zinc finger protein', 'Article', 'BCAP31 gene', 'C1QBP gene', 'cancer growth', 'CDKN2A gene', 'cell proliferation', 'controlled study', 'DNA methylation', 'DNA methylation assay', 'DNA vector', 'down regulation', 'embryo', 'epigenetics', 'female', 'gene expression regulation', 'gene targeting', 'genetic transcription', 'genetic transfection', 'HEK293 cell line', 'HIST1H1D gene', 'human', 'human cell', 'immune response', 'immune-related gene', 'immunity', 'mass spectrometry', 'nonhuman', 'plasmid', 'prediction', 'priority journal', 'promoter region', 'protein interaction', 'proteomics', 'PTMS gene', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'signal transduction', 'SiHa cell line', 'uterine cervix cancer', 'Wart virus', 'ZMYM6 gene']","['aDepartment of Molecular Tropical Medicine and Genetics, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Botany, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cCenter of Excellence in Systems Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'dCenter of Excellence in Immunology and Immune-mediated Diseases, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eDepartment of Tropical Nutrition and Food Science, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand']",[]

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the complex pore structures of the MCFs were retained after the functionalization at relatively high temperature (573K). TGA and FTIR results showed that the functionalization led to a reduction of water adsorbed on the surfaces of the MCF. The functionalization improved adsorption of benzene compared to the pristine MCF and the optimum HMDS:MCF molar ratio was 1.5. The amount of benzene adsorbed has a linear relationship with the concentration of benzene in the environment.

α7-Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist QND7 suppresses non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and migration via inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling(Article),"['Witayateeraporn, W.', 'Arunrungvichian, K.', 'Pothongsrisit, S.', 'Doungchawee, J.', 'Vajragupta, O.', 'Pongrakhananon, V.']","Volume 521, Issue 4, 22 January 2020, Pages 977-983","Lung cancer, one of the most commonly found carcinoma type, has the highest mortality rate in cancer patients worldwide. Therapeutic interventions targeting to lung cancer become remaining the world significant challenge. Recently, the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) was reported to play an important role in the mechanism underlying lung cancer progression, being intriguing drug target for lung cancer therapy. Hence, the top four α7-nAChR antagonists (QND7, PPRD10, PPRD11 and PPRD12) among our previously developed ligands were proceeded to the in vitro anti-cancer evaluations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (H460 and A549). In this study, we found that QND7 exhibited the highest cytotoxic effect and induced cell apoptosis in both cell lines at a level comparable to cisplatin, whereas the PPRD compounds showed much lower cytotoxicity. Low doses of QND7 and PPRD11 were able to suppress H460 and A549 cell proliferation, whereas PPRD10 and PPRD12 were considered ineffective. In an in vitro wound healing assay, QND7-treatment showed the greatest suppression of H460 and A549 cell migration. The variations in the anti-cancer activities of PPRD compounds might be, at least in part of, their non-selective antagonisms to serotonin receptor (5-HT3) and α4β2-nAChR. Further investigation revealed that QND7 was able to minimize protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) activity, in correlating to its anti-cancer effects. These findings warrant QND7 for further preclinical evaluation and demonstrate the potential of α7-nAChR as cancer drug target. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,"{'ISSN': '0006291X', 'Source Type': 'BBRCA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.018', 'Publisher': '31727368'}","['Antagonist', 'Cell death', 'Cell migration', 'Cell proliferation', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor', 'bungarotoxin receptor', 'protein kinase B', 'target of rapamycin kinase', 'triazole derivative', 'apoptosis', 'cell motion', 'cell proliferation', 'chemistry', 'drug effect', 'human', 'IC50', 'lung tumor', 'metabolism', 'non small cell lung cancer', 'pathology', 'signal transduction', 'tumor cell line', 'alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Triazoles']","['aDepartment of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bPreclinical Toxicity and Efficacy Assessment of Medicines and Chemicals Research Cluster, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Food and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eResearch Affairs, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'Phar2560-RG08', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'MRG6280235,RAP60K0001', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': ''}]"

Developing and validating a scale of consumer-based brand equity for SMEs: evidence from Thailand(Article),"['Chokpitakkul, N.', 'Anantachart, S.']","Volume 27, Issue 3, 9 Jun 2020, Pages 383-404","Purpose: This study aimed to develop a generalisable small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) brand equity scale and examine its relationship with consumer response factors. Design/methodology/approach: The study which was done in Thailand included three steps. First, brand communications of 40 successful SMEs and opinions of 56 consumers were collected by document analysis, interview and focus group for generating items and measurement of stimuli. Second, 838 consumers were surveyed to define the dimensions of the brand equity and the top SMEs. Third, surveys with 552 customers of the three most popular SMEs, one from each of the manufacturing, service and trade businesses, were conducted to examine the scale's invariance and its relationships with consumer responses. Findings: The SME brand equity (SMEBE) scale included 23 items that were grouped into five components named brand awareness, functionality, authenticity, attentiveness and resonance. The scale is applicable across consumers that vary in their product involvement and brand engagement. The SMEBE significantly affected the brand's preference, loyalty and word-of-mouth. Research limitations/implications: Since the SMEBE scale was tested with three brands, one from each of three business sectors, future studies should measure more than one SME for each business type. To allow for potential cultural characteristics that might affect the study, replications in diverse international settings are required. Practical implications: SME managers should increase the awareness, functionality, authenticity, attentiveness and resonance of their brands as these components are essential for SMEBE, which, in turn, significantly affects consumer behaviour. Originality/value: This study develops a ready-to-use SMEBE scale and introduces a practical research design for quantitative research on SME branding. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development,"{'ISSN': '14626004', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1108/JSBED-04-2019-0138', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Brand equity', 'Brand performance measurement', 'SME', 'Thailand']","['Faculty of Communication Arts, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

The study is qualitative in nature, relying on document analysis and content analysis of the selected magazines. The result shows that there are 39 issues, most of which contain folk Buddhism. The visible difference in content between amulet magazines and animist magazines is found in their compositions, i.e., amulet magazines, which mainly deal with small Buddha images and amulet, is composed of color pictures, monk and amulet pictures, amulet advertisement, myths and stories followed by news and activities, coupons, souvenirs (free posters and sacred objects), while animist magazines concern stories of sacred things containing lucky numbers, myths and mysterious stories, monk and amulet pictures, horoscope, amulet advertisements, novels, and coupons respectively. Pictures, souvenirs and coupons are interestingly important compositions in both types of magazines. The compositions of animist and amulet magazines reflect a cycle related to amulet traders, collectors and gamblers. The magazines are the platform providing spaces for advertising beneficial to magazine producers, temples, sacred place and object owners. It is also a great way for amulet buyers and gamblers in pursuit of fortune and relevant information. They are thus still an effective instrument used to encourage religious beliefs and concerning businesses for the specific groups of people. © 2020 Silpakorn University.

Combining biochar and zerovalent iron (BZVI) as a paddy field soil amendment for heavy cadmium (Cd) contamination decreases Cd but increases zinc and iron concentrations in rice grains: a field-scale evaluation(Article),"['Khum-in, V.', 'Suk-in, J.', 'In-ai, P.', 'Piaowan, K.', 'Phaimisap, Y.', 'Supanpaiboon, W.', 'Phenrat, T.']","Volume 141, September 2020, Pages 222-233","Consuming rice grown in contaminated soil that has an elevated level of cadmium (Cd) is a health risk. This study revealed that using a combination of biochar and zerovalent iron (BZVI) reduces the concentration of Cd and enhances that of the essential elements zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) in rice. The Cd concentration in brown rice grain cultivated in an untreated paddy was 0.84 ± 0.20 mg kg−1, double the acceptable level (0.4 mg kg−1). Soil amendment with BZVI successfully decreased Cd in brown rice by 83 % compared to the untreated field presumably due to the Cd sorption on biochar (BC) and enhanced ZVI corrosion by-products while ZVI and BC alone achieved only 40 % and 74 % reduction, respectively. Moreover, while using ZVI or BC alone decreased Fe in rice grain by 8–14 %, BZVI enhanced the Fe concentrations in rice grain by 11 % because of Fe2+/Fe3+release from BC-enhanced ZVI corrosion. Similarly, the presence of BC in BZVI enhanced Zn accumulation in rice grain by 8% due to competitive sorption of Cd2+on BZVI, which may desorb Zn2+, promoting Zn translocation to rice.

Does the social capital matters in buyer-supplier relationships? A Thai perspective(Article),"['Piriyawatthana, W.', 'Phumdara, T.', 'Jermsittiparsert, K.']","Volume 9, Issue 1, 2020, Pages 1-9","The main objective of the current study is to investigate the influence of the social capital theory in the relationship between buyer and supplier relationship. The study is of the view that the there are certain managerial implications of social capital in terms of buyer supplier relationships, therefore, considering these, significant resources are invested by the buyers to generate social capital along with its suppliers. Thus, a social capital which is earned after huge efforts may sometimes result in poor decision making, opportunistic behaviors, and loss of objectivity. The study has used the survey-based methodology and examined the manners or the Thai Petro chemical firms Considering a buyer supplier relationship, we attempt to theorize social capital contradiction and empirical evidence is presented for the social capital and performance relationship as a curvilinear relationship at inter-firm level. The results of this research are found to be in line with a few recent researches which examined the impact of this curvilinear relationship at group, network, or individual level. The findings suggest that social capital and performance relationship has an inverted curvilinear relationship. The empirical findings indicate that in case of buyer-supplier collaboration for gaining strategic benefits, more time is consumed for making it to the threshold level, as compared to the case of operational benefits. © 2020 ExcelingTech Pub, UK.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,"{'ISSN': '20513771', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': 'Article', 'Publisher': 'ExcelingTech'}","['Social capital', 'Supply chain', 'Thailand']","['aCollege of Innovation and Management, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bSocial Research Institute, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]
Stock Return Prediction Using Dual-Stage Attention Model with Stock Relation Inference(Conference Paper),"['Chiewhawan, T.', 'Vateekul, P.']","Volume 12033 LNAI, 2020, Pages 492-503","Deep learning models have become widely accessible for stock prediction tasks. However, most of the research in this area focuses on only a single stock or an index and often formulates the problem to optimize only on the accuracy. Our paper proposed a more profit-oriented framework by formulating the problem into multiple stock returns prediction as well as introducing a relation inference for stock ranking. This setup can diversify investment and eventually enhance trading profits while maintaining the regression accuracy. Moreover, it is become more challenging to process multiple time-series features simultaneously because of the great variety of available information in the financial market. We mitigate this with the state-of-the-art model for time-series forecasting, the Dual-stage attention recurrent neural networks (DA-RNN), and train them with the shared-parameter model setting. The attention layer within DA-RNN helps the model captures the relevance insight among the features. We conducted experiments on major 64 target stocks from the SET market with RMSE, mean reciprocal rank, and annualized profit returns as evaluation metrics. The results show that our proposed model framework (DA-RANK) can predict multiple stock returns in ranking order and able to produce a desirable improvement in profitability over other baseline models. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"{'ISSN': '03029743', 'Source Type': '978-303041963-9', 'Original Language': 'Book Series'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/978-3-030-41964-6_42', 'Publisher': 'Conference Paper'}","['Deep learning', 'Dual-stage attention', 'Long Short-term memory model', 'Ranking-aware loss function', 'Stock prediction', 'Stock ranking', 'Commerce', 'Database systems', 'Deep learning', 'Electronic trading', 'Financial markets', 'Forecasting', 'Investments', 'Profitability', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Time series', 'Dual stage', 'Loss functions', 'Short term memory', 'Stock predictions', 'Stock ranking', 'Learning systems']","['Chulalongkorn University Big Data Analytics and IoT Center (CUBIC), Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']",[]
Eco composites with synergistic combinations of natural rubber latex and wood flour toughened recycled HDPE(Article),"['Bijaisoradat, O.', 'Luttapreecha, M.', 'Manuspiya, H.']","Volume 25, December 2020, Article number 101483","The recycling of thermoplastic waste reinforced with agricultural products has gained significant attention owing to its benefits towards the economy and the environment. Natural rubber latex (NRL), abundantly found in South East Asia, and wood flour (WF) were added to recycled high-density polyethylene (reHDPE) forming a three-phase composite with the aim of improving the composite's mechanical resilience, where WF strengthens the composite. The composition of reHDPE was fixed at 80 wt. % and the two fillers were varied to observe the effects of fillers on the mechanical properties, specifically impact resistance. The addition of only 5 wt.% NRL (WF15 NRL5) raises the impact resistance up to 100 % with respect to the composite with only 20 wt.% wood flour. The composition with 5 wt.% WF and 15 wt.% NRL (WF5 NRL15) exhibited the highest impact resistance of 483 J/m and the best processing conditions due to the dispersion of NRL in the polymer matrix. The flexible properties were improved in the NRL-dominated composition. Additionally, higher NRL content increases the decomposition temperature, thus allowing tunable adjustments to the compositions for practical applications.

There is a substantial need for further research and development to identify and develop more efficacious agents/regimens in order to improve clinical outcomes of patients for whom the prognosis is unfavorable. Recently, mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, has been found to have anticancer activity against osteosarcoma in both in vitro and animal experiments, so that further investigation in humans is warranted. Methods: A total of 27 patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma will be enrolled into this phase II, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, two-stage clinical trial. The main objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in the patients. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 16 weeks; the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, overall response rate, safety parameters, pharmacokinetic parameters, biomarkers, pain score, and quality of life. Mycophenolate mofetil at the initial dose of 5 g/day or lower will be administered for 4 cycles (28 days/cycle) or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of mycophenolate mofetil may be reduced by 1-2 g/day or withheld for some Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicities whenever clinically needed. The duration of study participation is approximately 4-5 months, with a minimum of 12 study visits. If mycophenolate mofetil proves beneficial to some patients, as evidenced by stable disease or partial response at 16 weeks, administration of mycophenolate mofetil will continue in the extension period. Discussion: This trial is the first step in the translation of therapeutic potential of mycophenolate mofetil emerging from in vitro and animal studies into the clinical domain. It is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma. The results will provide important information about whether or not mycophenolate mofetil is worth further development.

VD deficiency is associated with liver fibrosis progression. Metabolic dysfunction of the liver, as an intermediate organ for VD metabolism, contributes partly to this deficiency. We hypothesized that improving hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients after eradication with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) would increase 25-hydroxyVD [25(OH)VD] levels. Methods: Eighty CHC patients (17 chronic hepatitis, and 63 cirrhosis) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, hepatitis C viral load (VL), genotypes, liver enzymes and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) were assessed at baseline. Blood samples for 25(OH)VD and the procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) were collected at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks. LSMs were re-evaluated at 48 weeks. Serum 25(OH)VD levels < 30 ng/mL were defined as VD insufficiency/deficiency. Paired t-tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: Among 80 patients, the mean age was 57.7 ± 10.5 years, and 52.5% were men. The mean VL was 6.1 ± 0.7 logIU/mL with genotype 1 predominance (55%). All patients achieved sustained virological response. The alanine aminotransferase levels decreased from 79.9 ± 53.3 U/L at baseline to 25.7 ± 17.2 and 22.3 ± 11.0 U/L at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean LSM decreased from 19.2 ± 15.3 to 11.7 ± 8.0 kPa at 48 weeks (p < 0.001). The P3NP levels decreased from 43.6 ± 22.0 ng/mL before treatment to 35.7 ± 21.1 and 29.4 ± 15.0 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The proportions of VD insufficiency/deficiency were 72.5%, 91.3%, and 86.5% at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. The 25(OH)VD levels decreased from 26.3 ± 10.7 ng/mL at baseline to 20.8 ± 8.1 and 20.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Curative treatment with DAA attenuated the liver stiffness and inflammation but did not improve VD levels. Over 80% of patients remained VD insufficient/deficient. Whether VD replacement during and after DAA therapy can improve hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.

Computational fluid dynamic design of spent coffee ground cabinet dryer using recycled heat from air compressor(Article),"['Prommuak, C.', 'Tharangkool, N.', 'Pavasant, P.', 'Ponpesh, P.', 'Jarunglumlert, T.']","Volume 153, January 2020, Pages 75-84","This study designed a cabinet dryer assembled to an air compressor to utilize a free-of-charge waste heat for drying. Spent coffee ground (SCG), a residue from coffee brewing, was the tested material. Applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD), an appropriate cabinet dryer configuration could be achieved. As varying the hot air inlet/outlet position, the best drying characteristics providing uniform air flow occurred when hot air entered the chamber at the top and left the chamber at the bottom, opposite side to the inlet. A model dryer was then developed and used to validate the CFD prediction of dryer capacity which was dependent on the maximum numbers of mounted trays and the thickness of SCG layer. The computational prediction agreed well with the experimental results, showing that the dryer loading SCG at 3 cm thickness performed best with two trays in the chamber. Adding another tray would result in an obstruction of the air flow, leaving more than 20% of the moisture content in the final product. Experimental determination of drying duration for drying SCG with varying thickness indicated that each centimeter of the increase in SCG bed thickness extended the drying duration by 3 fold. Particularly at the SCG layer thickness of 4 cm, this fitted well with the simulation results at 97.2% accuracy. Mounted with 3 trays, each loaded 300 g SCG (1 cm bed thickness), the dryer could complete 6 cycles within regular operation hours of a coffee shop (12 h) and thus accounted for 5400 g of SCG as daily capacity of a dryer. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Chemical Engineering Research and Design,"{'ISSN': '02638762', 'Source Type': 'CERDE', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.cherd.2019.10.017', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Air compressor', 'Computational fluid dynamics', 'Dryer', 'Spent coffee ground', 'Waste heat', 'Air', 'Compressors', 'Computational fluid dynamics', 'Dryers (equipment)', 'Drying', 'Waste heat', 'Computational predictions', 'Drying characteristics', 'Experimental determination', 'Free of charge', 'Layer thickness', 'Regular operations', 'Spent coffee grounds', 'Varying thickness', 'Gas compressors']","['aEnergy Research Institute, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Chemical Engineering, School of Energy Science and Engineering, Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology, Rayong, Thailand', 'cThai Roong Rueng Research and Development Co., Ltd, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', ""eFaculty of Science, Energy and Environment, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (Rayong Campus), Rayong, Thailand""]","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'VISTEC'}]"

The clinical and biomarker diagnosis of this disorder is hampered by the lack of validated diagnostic criteria and laboratory tests with adequate figures of merit, although there are now many disease biomarkers indicating the pathophysiology of CFS. Here, we review multiple factors, such as immunological and environmental factors, which are associated with CFS and evaluate current concepts on the involvement of immune and environmental factors in the pathophysiology of CFS. The most frequently reported immune dysregulations in CFS are modifications in immunoglobulin contents, changes in B and T cell phenotypes and cytokine profiles, and decreased cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Some of these immune aberrations display a moderate diagnostic performance to externally validate the clinical diagnosis of CFS, including the expression of activation markers and protein kinase R (PKR) activity. Associated with the immune aberrations are activated nitro-oxidative pathways, which may explain the key symptoms of CFS. This review shows that viral and bacterial infections, as well as nutritional deficiencies, may further aggravate the immune-oxidative pathophysiology of CFS. Targeted treatments with antioxidants and lipid replacement treatments may have some clinical efficacy in CFS. We conclude that complex interactions between immune and nitro-oxidative pathways, infectious agents, environmental factors, and nutritional deficiencies play a role in the pathophysiology of CFS. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Molecular Neurobiology,"{'ISSN': '08937648', 'Source Type': 'MONBE', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s12035-020-01939-w', 'Publisher': '32761353'}","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Environmental factors', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Neuro-immune', 'Nutritional deficiencies', 'antioxidant', 'biological marker', 'cytokine', 'dental amalgam', 'glycophospholipid', 'immunoglobulin', 'mercury', 'minerals plus multivitamins', 'nickel', 'protein kinase R', 'selenium', 'biological marker', 'B lymphocyte', 'bacterial infection', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'delayed hypersensitivity', 'environmental factor', 'human', 'immune response', 'ionizing radiation', 'natural killer cell', 'neuroimmunology', 'nonhuman', 'nutritional deficiency', 'oxidative stress', 'pathophysiology', 'protein expression', 'Review', 'risk factor', 'selenium deficiency', 'T lymphocyte', 'virus infection', 'brain', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'environment', 'immunology', 'metabolism', 'microbiology', 'pathology', 'radiation response', 'virology', 'Biomarkers', 'Brain', 'Environment', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Radiation, Ionizing']","['aCouncil for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine, Toften 24, Mo i Rana, 8610, Norway', 'bAgricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Karaj, Iran', 'cSemey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan', 'dCONEM Kazakhstan Environmental Health and Safety Research Group, Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan', 'eDepartment of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Ovidius University of Constanta, Campus, Constanta, 900470, Romania', 'fDepartment of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'gImpact Research Center, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia']",[]
A narrative review of the literature on the reproductive health of female sex workers having age below twenty years(Review)(Open Access),"['Wahed, T.', 'Zaman, S.', 'Huda, F.A.', 'Jiayu, L.', 'Sultana, S.', 'Alam, A.', 'Panza, A.', 'Somrongthong, R.']","Volume 19, Issue 1, 7 November 2020, Pages 17-31","Objective: Female sex workers (FSWs) under 20 years of age range from 1,000 to 575,000 in different cities and countries across the globe. There is only a handful of information on the reproductive health (RH) issues of these younger FSWs in the perspective of service utilization and healthcare system. We reviewed existing literature with a view to describe the reproductive health problems, service utilization, and service availability as well as information sources among the FSWs ages <20 years. Materials and methods: A web-based search using Google, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/ PubMed/ PubMed Central, HINARI and JSTOR was performed in English Language. The prevalence of a health issue and percentage of service utilization had been shown using ranges of minimum and maximum value which were calculated by different studies. Results: Findings identified the following RH problems: unintended pregnancies (52%-95%), induced abortion (51%-53%), repeated or multiple abortions (13%-43%), childbirth experiences, sexually transmitted infections (74%-84%), HIV (1%-60.6%), violence (beaten, robbed, not paid, forced or coerced sex, rape) and mental disorders (depression, suicidal thoughts). The consistent use of condom (26%-55%) was not satisfactory. Overall 64% of under 20 years FSWs reported little or no access to healthcare in the previous year and access to RH information sources was also poor. Conclusion: This review has potentially meant to bring forward the RH issues of younger FSWs to the policy makers and programme planners to implement targeted reproductive health interventions for the FSWs ages <20 years. © 2019, Ibn Sina Trust.

Enhancing thermal and chemical sensitivity of polydiacetylene colorimetric sensors: The opposite effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles(Article),"['Phonchai, N.', 'Khanantong, C.', 'Kielar, F.', 'Traiphol, R.', 'Traiphol, N.']","Volume 589, 20 February 2020, Article number 124459","This contribution presents our continuing effort to develop polydiacetylene (PDA)/zinc(II) ion (Zn2+)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite for colorimetric sensing. In our previous studies, PDAs with monocarboxylic headgroup have been used to fabricate the nanocomposites. The incorporation of Zn2+/ZnO enhances overall interactions, resulting in reversible thermochromism with color-transition temperature (TCT) higher than that of the original PDA. Here, we extend this concept to the system of 3-(pentacosa-10,12-diynamido) benzoic acid (PCDA-mBzA) monomer constituting aromatic headgroup. Pure poly(PCDA-mBzA) assemblies exhibit reversible thermochromism with TCT∼90 °C. Interestingly, the fabrication of poly(PCDA-mBzA)/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites using 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of ZnO nanoparticles results in a systematic decrease of TCTto about 80, 70 and 60 °C, respectively while the reversible thermochromism remains. The observed effect of ZnO nanoparticles is opposite to our previous studies. Structural analysis by utilizing infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction reveals that the Zn2+ions intercalate the bilayer structure of poly(PCDA-mBzA). The intercalation process perturbs local organization of aromatic headgroups, reducing the strength of overall interactions.

Good practice and lesson learned in promoting vetiver as solution for slope stabilisation and erosion control in Thailand(Article),"['Leknoi, U.', 'Likitlersuang, S.']","Volume 99, December 2020, Article number 105008","Landslide and soil erosion are critical issues and an undoubtedly dreadful potential for mountainous areas worldwide. These issues are magnified when they are faced by lower-income countries, countries that experiences intense rainfalls, or countries that face both of these realities. In any of these cases, solutions for disaster management should be simple, economical and cost-effective. The application of vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizaniodes) has been widely promoted in tropical regions as a cost-effective and environmental-friendly solution for slope stabilisation and erosion control for many years. Despite its potential, vetiver grass utilisation has not been widely accepted by disadvantaged agricultural communities at landslide hazard areas. The failure to promote vetiver grass use in these areas is primarily caused by a lacking of a sustainable model for vetiver grass implementation in rural communities. The purpose of this ex-post facto research is to examine the good practical model in two communities that have successfully established vetiver grass utilisation for land and water conservation. Research findings revealed that there are two important key elements in the success of these two communities. First, creation of community potential in the forms of human resource and leadership enhanced the community's support in finding an appropriate solution to solve their own problems. Second, networking and assistance from government and non-government organisations in marketing campaign gave the communities the resources they needed to effectively implement vetiver grass use. Together, these two key elements form a sustainable model in which communities will receive the support they need in order to achieve sustainable short-term and long-term vetiver grass utilisation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Land Use Policy,"{'ISSN': '02648377', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105008', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Landslide', 'Soil erosion', 'Sustainable solution', 'Vetiver grass', 'erosion control', 'grass', 'landslide', 'local participation', 'rainfall', 'slope dynamics', 'slope stabilization', 'soil erosion', 'Thailand', 'Chrysopogon']","['aChulalongkorn University Social Research Institute, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bCentre of Excellence in Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': '760003-CC,762003-CC,763014', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': 'NA170293', 'Acronym': ''}]"
Target Induced-DNA strand displacement reaction using gold nanoparticle labeling for hepatitis E virus detection(Article),"['Ngamdee, T.', 'Yin, L.S.', 'Vongpunsawad, S.', 'Poovorawan, Y.', 'Surareungchai, W.', 'Lertanantawong, B.']","Volume 1134, 16 October 2020, Pages 10-17","DNA strand displacement is an attractive, enzyme-free target hybridization strategy for nano-biosensing. The target DNA induces a strand displacement reaction by replacing the pre-hybridized strand that is labeled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Thus, the amount of displaced-AuNP-labeled strand is proportional to the amount of target DNA in the sample. The use of a magnetogenosensing technique to isolate the target DNA allows for a simple, one-pot detection approach, which minimizes possible carry-over contamination and pipetting errors. We sought a proof-of-concept for this technology in its ability to detect DNA-equivalent of hepatitis E virus (HEV), which causes acute viral hepatitis for which rapid and simple diagnostic methods remain limited. Signal detection was done via visual observation, spectrophotometry, and electrochemistry. The sensor demonstrated good sensitivity with detection limits of 10 pM (visual), 10 pM (spectrophotometry) and 1 fM (electrochemical). This sensor also exhibited high specificity for real target amplicons and could discriminate between perfect and mismatched sequences. Lyophilized biosensor reagents stored at 4 °C, 25 °C, and outdoor ambient temperature, were stable for up to 90, 50, and 40 days, respectively.

Factors affecting the consumption of energy-efficient lighting products: Exploring purchase behaviors of Thai consumers(Article)(Open Access),"['Apipuchayakul, N.', 'Vassanadumrongdee, S.']","Volume 12, Issue 12, 1 June 2020, Article number 4887","The continued usage of inefficient lighting products in residential sectors is one of the major causes of the rapid growth in global energy consumption. Their replacement with highly efficient lighting appliances could avoid large amounts of electricity consumption and reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. In this regard, the collective contribution by the residential sector is extremely important and the increase in demand for energy-efficient lighting products can help achieve sustainability goals. This study aims to examine the determinants of household consumers' behaviors in purchasing energy-saving lighting products by applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the main theoretical framework. Data (n = 288) from a survey in Thailand were analyzed using causal Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results suggested that attitude has the largest direct effect, while subjective norm was the weakest predictor of purchase intention towards light-emitting diode (LED) products. In addition, this study expands the TPB by including an investigation of a direct effect of attitude on purchase behavior. The results suggest that attitudes have a strong direct influence on the purchasing behavior for LED products. Additionally, only some socio-demographic variables have significant effects on purchase behavior. The study's findings highlight several implications for policymakers, the private sector, and green marketers in developing practical strategies.

Mastering nocturnal jigsaws in Parkinson’s disease: a dusk-to-dawn review of night-time symptoms(Review),"['Bhidayasiri, R.', 'Sringean, J.', 'Trenkwalder, C.']","Volume 127, Issue 5, 1 May 2020, Pages 763-777","Finding out about night-time symptoms from Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients can be a challenge as many patients and their carers cannot recall many symptoms that occur during the night, resulting in an under-recognition or a large variability of responses from clinical interviews and scales. Moreover, technology-based assessments for most night-time symptoms are still not universally available for use in a patient’s home environment. Therefore, most physicians rely on their clinical acumen to capture these night-time symptoms based on pieces of patients’ history, bedpartner’s reports, clinical features, associated symptoms or conditions. To capture more night-time symptoms, the authors identified common nocturnal symptoms based on how they manifest from dusk to dawn with selected features relevant to PD. While some symptoms occur in healthy individuals, in PD patients, they may impact differently. The authors intend this narrative review to provide a practical guide on how these common night-time symptoms manifest and highlight pertinent issues by focusing on prevalence, clinical symptomatology, and specific relationships to PD. It is also important to recognise that PD-specific sleep disturbances increase with advancing disease with additional contributions from ageing, comorbidities, and medication side effects. However, the relative contribution of each factor to individual symptom may be different in individual patient, necessitating clinical expertise for individual interpretation. While there are debatable issues in certain areas, they underlie the complexity of night-time symptoms. Understanding night-time symptoms in PD is like re-arranging jigsaw pieces of clinical information to create, but never complete, a picture for physicians to instigate appropriate management. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Journal of Neural Transmission,"{'ISSN': '03009564', 'Source Type': 'JNTRF', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s00702-020-02170-6', 'Publisher': '32172472'}","['Excessive daytime somnolence', 'Insomnia', 'Nocturia', 'Nocturnal hypokinesia', 'Nocturnal manifestations', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'REM sleep\xa0behaviour disorder', 'aging', 'akinesia', 'circadian rhythm', 'comorbidity', 'daytime somnolence', 'human', 'hypokinesia', 'insomnia', 'night sleep', 'nocturia', 'parasomnia', 'Parkinson disease', 'periodic limb movement disorder', 'physician', 'practice guideline', 'prevalence', 'priority journal', 'psychosis', 'restless legs syndrome', 'Review', 'sleep disorder', 'sleep disordered breathing', 'complication', 'parasomnia', 'Parkinson disease', 'pathophysiology', 'Humans', 'Parasomnias', 'Parkinson Disease']","['aChulalongkorn Centre of Excellence for Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, 1873 Rama 4 Road, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Neurosurgery, University Medical Centre Goettingen, Paracelsus-Elena Hospital, Kassel, Germany']","[{'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': 'IRN59W0005,RTA6280016', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '2300042200,GCE 6100930004-1', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Science Research and Innovation', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'TSRI'}]"

Results on the mechanical properties of hydrogels, n-butanol additive enhanced a higher compressive modulus up to ~ 22 times in comparison to non-alcoholic fibroin hydrogel.

The N-dimension computing machine postulate(Article)(Open Access),"['Sophatsathit, P.']","Volume 8, 2020, Pages 173044-173055","This paper postulates a novel N-dimension computing machine that operates in an unconventional manner. This postulate aims at solving existing problems in higher dimensions, where one must re-think the scope of a given problem domain beyond the one-dimension Turing machine to dictate all subsequent problem representation, problem transformation, and algorithmic derivation. Two oversimplified well-known problems, namely, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Tower of Hanoi problem are presented to demonstrate the point. Both synthetic problems are effectively adapted to solve a real world project. To realize the postulate in a viable architectural construct, data flow and molecular computers are investigated since they show potential computation power. Unfortunately, they are still confined to working in one-dimension domain. A biological-like architecture for software systems is proposed in three design aspects: structure, function, and behavior.

Activity pattern and resource use of two callosciurus species in different habitats in northeastern thailand(Article),"['Kobayashi, S.', 'Placksanoi, J.', 'Taksin, A.', 'Waengsothorn, S.', 'Aryuthaka, C.', 'Panha, S.', 'Izawa, M.']","Volume 68, 27 July 2020, Pages 654-661","Some squirrel species can adapt to areas of extensive human activities. However, few studies have compared the behaviour of such squirrels in human activity areas with that in their natural forest areas in the tropics. This study describes the activity pattern and resource use of Callosciurus finlaysonii and C. caniceps in a small residential area located in the dry evergreen and dry dipterocarp forests in Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand, by using route census survey. Both species were active in the morning and evening, just as they are in the forests, but the frequency of detection of C. finlaysonii was higher than that of C. caniceps. Intraspecific interactions were frequently observed in C. finlaysonii; however, interspecific interactions were not observed. Callosciurus finlaysonii used buildings and electric wires located above ground in open areas as pathways, whereas C. caniceps was not observed in open areas. Callosciurus finlaysonii consumed a greater diversity of food items than C. caniceps, including fruits, leaves, flowers, and seeds, whereas C. caniceps fed mainly on fruits/seeds. The present study showed that C. finlaysonii can use human activity areas. Callosciurus finlaysonii probably use the human activity area owing to the presence of fewer natural predators, its ability to survive in different type of environments, as well as its wide feeding habits, and the presence of fewer competitors. However, it was observed that C. caniceps scarcely used human modified areas. © National University of Singapore.",Raffles Bulletin of Zoology,"{'ISSN': '02172445', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.26107/RBZ-2020-0080', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Activity pattern', 'Callosciurine squirrels', 'Human activity', 'Resource use', 'Southeast Asia', 'Tropical seasonal dry forest']","['aFaculty of Science, University of the Ryukyus, 1 Senbaru, Okinawa, Nishihara, 903-023, Japan', 'bSakaerat Environmental Research Station, Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research, 1 Moo 9 Udom, Wang Nam Khieo, Nakhon Ratchasima, 30370, Thailand', 'cFaculty of Fishery, Kasetsart University, 50 Ngam Wong Wan Road, Lat Yao Chatuchak, Bangkok, 10900, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Biology, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Payathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eCenter of Excellence on Biodiversity, Ministry of Education and Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': 'BDC-PG2-159009', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0KAKEN', 'Funding Number': '16H05771', 'Acronym': 'KAKEN'}]"
"Administration of Candida Albicans to Dextran Sulfate Solution Treated Mice Causes Intestinal Dysbiosis, Emergence and Dissemination of Intestinal Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Lethal Sepsis(Article)(Open Access)","['Hiengrach, P.', 'Panpetch, W.', 'Worasilchai, N.', 'Chindamporn, A.', 'Tumwasorn, S.', 'Jaroonwitchawan, T.', 'Wilantho, A.', 'Chatthanathon, P.', 'Somboonna, N.', 'Leelahavanichkul, A.']","Volume 53, Issue 2, 1 February 2020, Pages 189-198","The influence of gut fungi in chronic colitis was investigated by repeated oral administration of Candida albicans in a 3% dextran sulfate solution (DSS) induced-colitis mouse model. Candida administration in the DSS (DSS+Candida) model enhanced the mortality rate and induced bacteremia (without candidemia) resulting from a gut perm-selectivity defect despite similar diarrheal severity in mice treated with DSS alone. The dominant fecal bacteria in DSS+Candida and DSS alone mice were Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacter spp., respectively, implying that Candida induced gut dysbiosis. Interestingly, chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial colonies, predominantly Pseudomonas spp., appeared in the feces and blood of DSS+Candida mice (not the DSS alone group) during fungal culture. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria were also isolated, ex vivo, by incubating mouse feces with DSS and heat-killed Candida or (1→3)-β-D-glucan, suggesting bacterial fermentation on fungi. Administration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria in the DSS+Candida model enhanced the severity of disease, and increased growth of isolated P aeruginosa in blood agar containing heat-killed Candida was demonstrated. These data suggested the selection of a highly virulent bacterial strain following fecal Candida presentation in the gut. Additionally, reduction of fecal fungi with fluconazole decreased the burden of chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria, attenuating the severity of DSS+Candida. In conclusion, gut Candida induced bacteremia in the DSS model through an inflammation-induced gut perm-selectivity defect and facilitated the growth of some gut bacteria. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing gut fungi could attenuate disease severity. Further investigation of gut fungi in inflammatory bowel disease is warranted. © 2019 by the Shock Society.

Thirty-Day Readmission and Cost Analysis in Patients With Cirrhosis: A Nationwide Population-Based Data(Article)(Open Access),"['Chirapongsathorn, S.', 'Poovorawan, K.', 'Soonthornworasiri, N.', 'Pan-ngum, W.', 'Phaosawasdi, K.', 'Treeprasertsuk, S.']","Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 March 2020, Pages 453-460","Accurate population-based data are needed on the rate, economic impact, and the long-term outcomes of readmission among patients with cirrhosis. To examine the rates, costs, and 1-year outcomes of patients readmitted within 30 days following their index hospitalization for complications of cirrhosis, we conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study involving all patients with cirrhosis in Thailand from 2009 through 2013, using data from the National Health Security Office databases, which included those from nationwide hospitalizations. Readmission was captured from hospitals at all health care levels across the country within the Universal Coverage Scheme. For the 134,038 patients hospitalized with cirrhosis, the overall 30-day readmission rate was 17%. Common causes of readmission consisted of complications of portal hypertension (47%) and infections (17%). After adjusting for multiple covariates, predictors of 30-day readmission included hepatocellular carcinoma (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.84-2.06), human immunodeficiency virus–related admission (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.51-2.17) and cholangiocarcinoma (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.3-2.05). In all, 2,936 deaths (13%) occurred during readmission, and an additional 14,425 deaths up to 1 year (63.5% total mortality among readmitted patients). Causes of death were mostly from liver-related mortality. Average cost at index admission for those with a 30-day readmission were significantly higher than those readmitted beyond 30 days or not readmitted. Conclusions: Patients hospitalized with cirrhosis complications had high rates of unscheduled 30-day readmission. Average hospitalization costs were high, and only 36.5% of patients readmitted within 30 days survived at 1 year. © 2020 The Authors.

Recovery of γ-oryzanol from rice bran oil soapstock derived calcium soap: Consideration of Hansen solubility parameters and preferential extractability in various solvents(Article),"['Daisuk, P.', 'Shotipruk, A.']","Volume 134, December 2020, Article number 110238","This study aimed to develop an effective procedure for the recovery of γ-oryzanol through calcium (Ca)-induced precipitation of rice bran oil soapstock (RBOS), a by-product of the RBO industry. The most suitable pretreatment condition was found to be saponification with sodium hydroxide at 2× the saponification value, 90 °C for 40 min, providing 100% and 63.5% conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids, respectively, and a 79.4% γ-oryzanol yield. Addition of calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution at 0.3 g CaCl2:1 g of sodium soap (Na-FA) effectively induced the precipitation of γ-oryzanol-containing calcium soap (Ca-FA). Based on experimental solubility measurements, theoretical Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), and a preferential extractability study, the most suitable extraction solvents were suggested to be ethyl acetate and furfural. Ethyl acetate gave a γ-oryzanol selective extractability and recovery of 55.4% and 59.3%, respectively, whilst those for furfural were 55.3% and 62.8%, respectively.

Accounting information system quality has positive influence on supply chain management capability in terms of customer relationship, manufacturing flow management, procurement effectiveness, and delivery time. Moreover, customer relationship, manufacturing flow management, procurement effectiveness, and delivery time in supply chain management capability have positive influence on sustainable competitive advantages. Accounting information system quality also has positive influence on sustainable competitive advantages. In addition, when considering total influence of endogenous latent variables, accounting information system quality has total influence on sustainable competitive advantages. The findings of this study can be applied to accounting information systems together with supply chains in order to create competitive advantages.

Optimization of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Patches for Repairing Fatigue Cracks in Steel Plates Using a Genetic Algorithm(Article)(Open Access),"['Do, B.', 'Lenwari, A.']","Volume 24, Issue 2, 1 April 2020, Article number 04020006","A practical design optimization of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) patches for repairing fatigue cracks in metallic structures is presented. The design procedure combines finite-element (FE), genetic programming (GP), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An optimum patch design is defined as the combination of design parameters that simultaneously minimizes the patch volume and reduces the stress intensity factor (SIF) range below the fatigue threshold range. A patching correction factor, which accounts for the positive effects of material and geometric properties of the patch and adhesive layer on the SIF solution, is proposed. The correction factor is developed by performing symbolic regression via GP analyses on the SIF values obtained from the three-dimensional FE models. The closed-form SIF solution facilitates the visualization of the effects of design parameters, simplifies the calculation of fatigue life, and reduces the computation effort for design optimization. An example of the center-cracked steel plate subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loading and then repaired with double-sided adhesive-bonded FRP patches is used to illustrate the optimization procedure. © 2020 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",Journal of Composites for Construction,"{'ISSN': '10900268', 'Source Type': 'JCCOF', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0001005', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Center-cracked plates', 'Crack patching', 'Design optimization', 'Fatigue cracks', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Stress intensity factor solution', 'Adhesives', 'Cracks', 'Fatigue crack propagation', 'Fiber reinforced plastics', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Genetic programming', 'Plates (structural components)', 'Reinforcement', 'Repair', 'Steel fibers', 'Stress intensity factors', 'Constant-amplitude fatigue loadings', 'Cracked plate', 'Design optimization', 'Fatigue cracks', 'Fiber reinforced polymers', 'Optimization procedures', 'Practical design optimizations', 'Stress intensity factor (SIF)', 'Fatigue of materials']","['aDept. of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn Univ., Phayathai Rd., Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bComposite Structures Research Unit, Faculty of Engineering, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn Univ., Phayathai Rd., Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

Solute particles are found to reach their targeted residue due to their unique interactions with the residues. Degree of slowing down of the protein depends on the interaction strength f. Unlike a predictable dependence of the radius of gyration of the same protein on interaction in an effective medium, it does not show a systematic dependence on interaction due to pinning caused by the solute binding. Spread of the protein chain is quantified by estimating its effective dimension (D) from scaling of the structure factor. Even with a lower solute–residue interaction, the protein chain appears to conform to a random-coil conformation (D ∼ 2) in its native phase where it is globular in absence of such solute environment. The structural spread at small length scale differs from that at large scale in presence of stronger interactions: D ∼ 2.3 at smaller length scale and D ∼ 1.4 on larger scale with f = 3.5 while D ∼ 1.4 at smaller length scale and D ∼ 2.5 at larger length scales with f = 4.0. © 2020",Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"{'ISSN': '03784371', 'Source Type': 'PHYAD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.physa.2020.124823', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Coarse-grained model', 'Interacting solute matrix', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'Protein CorA', 'Protein folding', 'Intelligent systems', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'Coarse grained models', 'Effective dimensions', 'Effective medium', 'Interaction strength', 'Radius of gyration', 'Random coil conformation', 'Selective binding', 'Structure factors', 'Proteins']","['aCenter of Excellence in Computational Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bFaculty of Science at Sriracha, Kasetsart University Sriracha Campus, Chonburi, 20230, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS  39406, United States']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'National Science FoundationSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NSF', 'Funding Number': 'ACI 1626217', 'Acronym': 'NSF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Science FoundationSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NSF', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NSF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'RBP'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

The powdery and compacted formulation of the raw materials was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), particle size distribution (PSD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and acoustic emission technique (AE). The milling mechanism comprised of essentially three stages of milling time viz.; 120, 240, and 360 min respectively, with no milling (0 min) serving as the control batch. During the first stage of milling (120 min), it was observed that the greatest deformation occurred for the powdery formulation with increasing surface area, control batch inclusive, from 26.4 to 41.1 m2g−1. It was also noticed that the density of the samples increased with progressive ball milling time. The mean crystallite sizes of un-milled and milled powders were calculated as 36.61, 48.82, 34.27 and 52.13 μm for control batch and powders milled at 120, 240, and 360 min, and denoted as MT0, MT120, MT240, and MT360, respectively. The mean crystallite sizes further reduced with increasing milling time up to 240 min and increased with milling time up to 360 min. These results were in line with the SEM findings. The acoustic emission (AE) intensity increased reaching a maximum at MT240, and a noticeable decline in the case of MT360 was observed.

Evaluation of lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with oral cancer(Article)(Open Access),"['Bin-Alee, F.', 'Arayataweegool, A.', 'Buranapraditkun, S.', 'Mahattanasakul, P.', 'Tangjaturonrasme, N.', 'Mutirangura, A.', 'Kitkumthorn, N.']","Volume 28, 2020, Article number e20200124, Pages 1-10","Objectives: To evaluate apoptotic levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and apoptotic regulatory proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) in lymphocyte subsets of oral cancer (OC) patients and healthy controls (HC). Methodology: The percentage of apoptotic cells and lymphocyte counts were measured in the first cohort using PBMCs obtained from 23 OC patients and 6 HC. In the second cohort, (OC, 33; HC, 13), the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Bax and Bcl-2 in CD19+B, CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD16+56+natural killer (NK) cells was determined via flow cytometry. Results: The percentage of apoptotic cells was higher in the PBMCs of OC patients than in HC patients, particularly in patients with stage IV cancer (p<0.05). However, lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in stage IV patients (p<0.05). NK CD19+B and CD16+56+cell counts were significantly lower in OC patients compared with HC patients (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively), but CD4+T cells were interestingly significantly higher in OC patients (p<0.001). While Bax MFI was slightly higher, Bcl-2 MFI was significantly lower for all four lymphocyte subsets in OC samples, particularly in stage IV patients, when compared with HC. Consequently, Bax/Bcl-2 ratios showed an upward trend from HC to OC patients, particularly those in stage IV. We found similar trends in Bax and Bcl-2 MFI for tumor stage, tumor size, and lymph node involvement. Conclusions: The increased lymphocyte apoptosis in stage IV OC patients may be related to higher Bax levels and lower Bcl-2 levels. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in lymphocytes may be useful to determine the prognosis of OC patients, and could be considered a mean for supportive treatment in the future. © 2020, Bauru School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo.

Chronology of gonadal development in the malayan snail-eating turtle malayemys macrocephala(Article),"['Pewphong, R.', 'Kitana, J.', 'Kitana, N.']","Volume 59, 2020, Article number 20, Pages 1-11","The snail-eating turtle, Malayemys macrocephala, is a common freshwater turtle that can be used as an animal model for developmental biology. However, a thorough investigation of its development is needed before this species can be used as a model. Thus, this study aimed to examine the gonadal development of M. macrocephala. Turtle eggs were collected from rice fields in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, Thailand, and transported to the laboratory. Eggs were incubated in microprocessor-controlled incubators and randomly dissected on a weekly basis to reveal the developing embryos, then their developmental stage was identified according to Yntema (1968). Primordial germ cells and gonad structure were processed through the paraffin method. Moreover, the dynamics of germ cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Examination of the gonad revealed four main stages of gonadal development: (i) germ cell migration, (ii) genital ridge appearance, (iii) testicular formation, and (iv) ovarian formation. In the male turtle (incubated at 26°C), gonad developed into the testis with medullary sex cords starting at Yntema stage 17. In the female turtle (incubated at 32°C), these sex cords then degenerated, followed by cortical development into an ovarian structure starting at Yntema stage 19. Subsequently, testicular and ovarian development occurred independently, and distinct sex organs were apparent at Yntema stage 25. In addition, the presumptive testis showed germ cell proliferation in the medulla at Yntema stages 17, 19, and 25 and germ cell apoptosis in the cortex at Yntema stages 19 and 25. The presumptive ovary showed germ cell proliferation in the cortex at Yntema stages 19 and 25, and germ cell apoptosis in the medulla at Yntema stages 19 and 25. © 2020 Academia Sinica, Taiwan.",Zoological Studies,"{'ISSN': '10215506', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.6620/ZS.2020.59-20', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Apoptosis', 'Embryos', 'Freshwater turtle', 'Microscopic examination', 'Proliferation']","['aDepartment of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bBioSentinel Research Group (Special Task Force for Activating Research), Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"
Filling-and-dragging technique for a particle-entrapment using triangular microwells(Article)(Open Access),"['Yingprathanphon, P.', 'Wongpakham, T.', 'Srituravanich, W.', 'Pimpin, A.']","Volume 24, Issue 2, 2020, Pages 63-74","Trapping particle such as a cell, cell spheroid or scaffold bead, in a large trapping spot, such as a microwell, is important in various biological aspects. To achieve high trapping efficacy, the management of two countering effects from hydrodynamic and gravitational force is a key requirement. To increase the possibility of controllable entrapment, this study proposed a new approach using the filling and dragging technique to trap particles. The investigation of the trapping efficacy in three different triangular microwells such as obtuse, equilateral and acute triangle was conducted. The extremely low flow rate was firstly introduced to fill the particles in the microwell, and the flow rate was subsequently increased to drag and rearrange the entrapped particles. High trapping rate of a single particle in an equilateral triangular microwell could reach 80% when trapping polystyrene beads. For biomaterial particle such as cell spheroid, the adhesiveness with the other and the microwell surface is the parameter that needs to be further investigated. © 2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

Assessing Minimum Parking Requirements and Parking Capacities of Residential Development in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region(Article),"['Chullabodhi, C.', 'Chalermpong, S.', 'Ratanawaraha, A.', 'Kato, H.']","Volume 2674, Issue 11, 1 September 2020, Pages 593-605","This paper examines whether minimum parking requirements affect parking provision in condominiums and what factors determine condominiums’ parking capacities. By calculating actual, required, and excess parking capacities, the paper finds that almost 90% of the sample condominiums in Bangkok and the surrounding municipalities in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region provide more parking spaces than required by law. The parking capacities in condominiums outside Bangkok are almost as high as those in Bangkok, despite their required minimums being half those of Bangkok. Only 11% of the sample condominiums provide the required minimums. The figure has decreased to zero in recent years, likely because of soaring land prices. These results suggest that developers’ decisions to provide parking are not determined by parking requirements but by market demand. Results from regression analyses show that parking capacities are determined by total floor area and number of dwelling units in a project, distance to the nearest transit station, and average unit price. Condominiums located in Bangkok are found to provide significantly more parking spaces than those in the suburban municipalities. This result has important policy implications for transit-oriented development, considering that accessibility to public transit is much better in Bangkok than the suburban areas. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",Transportation Research Record,"{'ISSN': '03611981', 'Source Type': 'TRRED', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1177/0361198120947716', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Apartment houses', 'Public policy', 'Bangkok', 'Floor areas', 'Land prices', 'Market demand', 'Metropolitan regions', 'Parking requirements', 'Parking spaces', 'Policy implications', 'Residential development', 'Unit prices', 'Regression analysis']","['aDepartment of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bTransportation Institute, Chulalongkorn University, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Urban and Regional Planning, Faculty of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University, Patumwan, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Civil Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"
Primary care management of allergic rhinitis: A cross-sectional study in four ASEAN countries(Article)(Open Access),"['Abdullah, B.', 'Snidvongs, K.', 'Recto, M.', 'Poerbonegoro, N.L.', 'Wang, D.Y.']","Volume 15, 28 January 2020, Article number 726","Background: In primary care, general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists are tasked with the frontline responsibility of identifying and managing allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. There are currently no consolidated data on current treatment practices, patient compliance, and usage of guidelines within Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Objective: To assess the attitudes and practices on AR of GPs and pharmacists in 4 ASEAN countries (Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia). Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 329 GPs and 548 pharmacists was conducted from May to November 2019. Participants answered a questionnaire focused on their i) current practice in the management of AR, ii) views on patient compliance, iii) understanding and usage of guidelines. Results: Clinical history was the most preferred method to diagnose AR by 95.4% of GPs and 58.8% of pharmacists. Second-generation antihistamines were the most widely available treatment option in GP clinics and pharmacies (94.8% and 97.2%) and correspondingly the most preferred treatment for both mild (90.3%, 76.8%) to moderate-severe rhinitis (90.3%, 78.6%) by GPs and pharmacists, respectively. Loratadine was ranked as the most preferred 2ndgeneration antihistamines (GP vs pharmacists: 55.3% vs 58.9%). More than 90% of GPs and pharmacists ranked length and efficacy of treatment as important factors that increase patient compliance. Awareness of the ARIA guidelines was high among GPs (80%) and lower among pharmacists (48.4%). However, only 63.3% of GPs and 48.2% of pharmacists knew how to identify AR patients. Conclusions: The survey in the 4 ASEAN countries has identified a need to strengthen the awareness and use of ARIA guidelines among the primary care practitioners. Adherence to ARIA guidelines, choosing the appropriate treatment option and prioritizing factors that increases patient compliance may contribute to better management outcomes of AR at the primary care practice. © 2020 BioMed Central Ltd..

Renal ultrasonographic shear-wave elastography and urinary procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide in chronic kidney disease dogs(Article)(Open Access),"['Thanaboonnipat, C.', 'Sutayatram, S.', 'Buranakarl, C.', 'Choisunirachon, N.']","Volume 13, Issue 9, 2020, Pages 1955-1965","Background and Aim: Renal fibrosis is a well-established pathological alteration associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in several species and progresses as CKD advances. Although a renal biopsy is the gold standard for determining renal fibrosis, it is an invasive, impractical method for clinical practice. In humans, ultrasonographic shear-wave elastography (SWE), a novel advanced diagnostic imaging tool, can evaluate renal parenchyma stiffness, and urinary procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide (uPIIINP), a promising renal fibrosis biomarker in humans, has increasingly been use applied to reduce the biopsies. This study compares renal tissue elasticity observed through SWE Young's modulus (E) values between healthy dogs (HD) and those with CKD. Materials and Methods: The E value acquired by SWE, uPIIINP levels, and renal function were evaluated in 15 CKD dogs and 15 HD. Results: The renal cortical E values were significantly higher than the renal medullary E values in both groups (p<0.001). Renal cortical and medullary E values in CKD dogs were significantly higher than in HD (p<0.01). Cortical E values had greater significant correlations with renal functional parameters than the medullary E values and had a significant positive correlation with concentrations of plasma creatinine (Cr) (p<0.001); blood urea nitrogen (p<0.01); urine protein Cr ratio (p<0.01); and fractional excretions of sodium (p<0.05), potassium (p<0.05), chloride (p<0.05), and magnesium (p<0.001) while they had a negative correlation with urine specific gravity (p<0.05) and urine osmolality to plasma osmolality ratio (p<0.05). The uPIIINP to Cr (uPIIINP/Cr) ratios of CKD dogs were higher than those of HD (p<0.001). Moreover, the uPIIINP/Cr levels presented significant correlations with the renal cortical E values (p<0.01) and also the renal functional parameters. Conclusion: SWE offers a complementary, non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool for evaluating renal tissue stiffness in CKD dogs with renal function deterioration. In addition, uPIIINP levels are associated with renal function and structural changes in dogs. Therefore, the uPIIINP level might be a non-invasive, complementary, and promising biomarker for evaluating renal fibrosis in canine CKD. Copyright © Thanaboonnipat, et al. Open Access.

Aims: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory moisturizer (MAS062D lotion) vs hydrophilic cream for the improvement of dry and barrier function skin in xerosis patients. Methods: A split site, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the elderly with moderate to severe xerosis, who received the 28-day twice daily application of MAS062D lotion and hydrophilic cream on the assigned shins. The evaluations on day 0, 14, and 28 were performed using clinical assessment, skin hydration by corneometer, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and biometric assessment. Results: There were 24 Thai elderly patients, of whom 87.5% were female (mean age = 58.04 years and mean xerosis severity scale (XSS) = 4.83). Both treatments revealed similar statistically significant improvement in XSS (P <.001). Interestingly, MAS062D lotion–treated side remarkably showed improvement of skin hydration compared with hydrophilic-treated side for 26.86 ± 7.94 vs 25.84 ± 5.1, 41.24 ± 6.92 vs 20.96 ± 6.8, 50.49 ± 8.2 vs 21.75 ± 8.29 at baseline, day 14, and 28, respectively (P-value <.001). Moreover, MAS062D lotion significantly yielded greater decrease in TEWL measurement and more erythema improvement than hydrophilic cream (P-value <.001). No serious adverse effects were observed with either treatment. Conclusion: The MAS062D lotion could potentially be an efficacious treatment for improvement of xerosis in the elderly, which is also safe and refrains from steroid side effects. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology,"{'ISSN': '14732130', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1111/jocd.13183', 'Publisher': '31609077'}","['anti-inflammatory agents', 'dermatitis', 'eczema', 'emollients', 'nonsteroidal', 'skin aging', 'therapeutics', 'antiinflammatory agent', 'atopiclair', 'dermatological agent', 'hydrophilic cream', 'mas 062d moisturizer lotion', 'unclassified drug', 'antiinflammatory agent', 'emollient agent', 'skin cream', 'adult', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'Article', 'biometry', 'clinical article', 'comparative effectiveness', 'controlled study', 'cutaneous parameters', 'disease severity', 'drug effect', 'drug efficacy', 'drug response', 'erythema', 'female', 'human', 'hydrophilicity', 'male', 'priority journal', 'pruritus', 'randomized controlled trial', 'rating scale', 'skin hydration', 'skin water loss', 'Thai (people)', 'treatment outcome', 'xerosis', 'xerosis severity scale', 'chemical phenomena', 'chemistry', 'comparative study', 'drug combination', 'follow up', 'middle aged', 'pathophysiology', 'physiology', 'severity of illness index', 'skin disease', 'thermoregulation', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Drug Combinations', 'Emollients', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Cream', 'Skin Diseases', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Water Loss, Insensible']","['aDivision of Dermatology, Chulabhorn International College of Medicine, Thammasat University, Amphur Klongluang, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]
Extractive Text Summarization for Thai Travel News Based on Keyword Scored in Thai Language(Conference Paper),"['Nathonghor, S.', 'Wichadakul, D.']","12 August 2020, Pages 32-36","In recent years, people are seeking for a solution to improve text summarization for Thai language. Although several solutions such as PageRank, Graph Rank, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) models, etc., have been proposed, research results in Thai text summarization were restricted due to limited corpus in Thai language with complex grammar. This paper applied a text summarization system for Thai travel news based on keyword scored in Thai language by extracting the most relevant sentences from the original document.

"Climate factors influence seasonal influenza activity in Bangkok, Thailand(Article)(Open Access)","['Suntronwong, N.', 'Vichaiwattana, P.', 'Klinfueng, S.', 'Korkong, S.', 'Thongmee, T.', 'Vongpunsawad, S.', 'Poovorawan, Y.']","Volume 15, Issue 9 September, September 2020, Article number e0239729","Yearly increase in influenza activity is associated with cold and dry winter in the temperate regions, while influenza patterns in tropical countries vary significantly by regional climates and geographic locations. To examine the association between influenza activity in Thailand and local climate factors including temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, we analyzed the influenza surveillance data from January 2010 to December 2018 obtained from a large private hospital in Bangkok. We found that approximately one in five influenza-like illness samples (21.6% or 6,678/30,852) tested positive for influenza virus. Influenza virus typing showed that 34.2% were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 46.0% were influenza A(H3N2), and 19.8% were influenza B virus. There were two seasonal waves of increased influenza activity. Peak influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity occurred in February and again in August, while influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were primarily detected in August and September. Time series analysis suggests that increased relative humidity was significantly associated with increased influenza activity in Bangkok. Months with peak influenza activity generally followed the most humid months of the year. We performed the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) multivariate analysis of all influenza activity on the 2011 to 2017 data to predict the influenza activity for 2018. The resulting model closely resembled the actual observed overall influenza detected that year. Consequently, the ability to predict seasonal pattern of influenza in a large tropical city such as Bangkok may enable better public health planning and underscores the importance of annual influenza vaccination prior to the rainy season. © 2020 Suntronwong et al.

Cancer nanomedicine(Book Chapter),"['Sansanaphongpricha, K.', 'Dana, P.', 'Yata, T.', 'Saengkrit, N.']","1 January 2020, Pages 537-566","Nanomedicine is now attracting researchers in the 21st century to make use of the unique characteristics of atomic and molecular assemblies constructed at nanoscale. The possibility of applying nanomaterials to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases makes nanomedicine one of the most attractive areas of nanotechnology. Consequently, nanomedicine is rapidly developed with the attempts to use nanomaterials as therapeutic nanocarriers. Nanomedicine involves the preparation and delivery of therapeutic drugs in the molecular and nanometer size range to the targeted site of action, especially cancer in the human body without affecting healthy organs and tissues. The importance of the targeted delivery of nanomedicine lies in the fact that almost 95% of the actual discovered drugs present poor pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. The aim of nanomedicine is to improve drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, nonspecific toxicity, immunogenicity, and the biorecognition of systems in order to attain maximum efficacy and minimum undesirable side effects. To achieve this, drug formulation, the route of administration, and specific targeting are major parameters to be considered. The current studies of three major nanomaterials applied in drug delivery against cancers including liposome-, inorganic-, and bio-based nanocarriers are summarized in this chapter, including nanocarrier platform, conceptual design, and their development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Activity of Fly Ash-Derived ZSM-5 and Zeolite X on Fast Pyrolysis of Millettia (Pongamia) Pinnata Waste(Article),"['Soongprasit, K.', 'Vichaphund, S.', 'Sricharoenchaikul, V.', 'Atong, D.']","Volume 11, Issue 2, 1 February 2020, Pages 715-724","Fly ash (FA), a by-product of coal combustion, is considered as waste due to its high content of lime and other impurities and is either disposed of in landfills or recycled. Utilization of waste FA as a starting material for the synthesis of zeolite catalysts is a promising solution to reuse this waste. Meanwhile, de-oiled Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata seed waste (PPW) is produced in large amounts from the bio-oil extraction process. This waste is of no value due to its toxicity. However, it was previously shown that the fast pyrolysis of PPW to produce biofuels resulted in oleic acid and other oxygenated (O)-compounds as the main composition (67.2%) with smaller levels of hydrocarbons (HCs). In this work, the catalytic upgrading fast pyrolysis of PPW over the FA-derived ZSM-5 (FA-ZSM-5) and zeolite X (FA-X) catalysts to enhance the formation of HCs was performed using a pyrolyzer interfaced with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), using various biomass to catalyst (B:C) weight ratios (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10). The FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X were derived from FA by alkali hydrothermal and alkali fusion methods, respectively. The result demonstrated that the pyrolysis vapors of PPW had a high content of undesirable components, such as carboxylic acids, oleic acid and other O-compounds (67.2%), whereas the aliphatic and aromatic HC contents were markedly lower. The presence of the synthesized FA-ZSM-5 or FA-X catalysts resulted in a major improvement in the pyrolysis vapor quality. Selectivity on total HCs (aliphatic and aromatic) was significantly increased with greater catalyst contents for both FA-ZSM-5 (90.6%) and FA-X (84.9%). FA-ZSM-5 exhibited a high selectivity for aromatic HCs (82.6%) while zeolite-X showed a higher selectivity towards aliphatic HCs (71.0%). The level of O-compounds was substantially decreased to 1.12% and 21.9% with FA-ZSM-5 at a B:C ratio of 1:10 and FA-X at a B:C ratio of 1:5, respectively. In addition, FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X reduced the content of nitrogenated-compounds from 24.8% (no catalyst) to 8.3% and 0.0%, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that FA-ZSM-5 had a higher HC selectivity and was more effective in promoting deoxygenation reactions, whereas FA-X significantly enhanced the denitrogenation reaction. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Waste and Biomass Valorization,"{'ISSN': '18772641', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s12649-019-00709-7', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Bio-oil', 'Fast pyrolysis', 'Fly ash', 'Millettia (Pongamia) Pinnata', 'Zeolite X', 'ZSM-5', 'Aromatic compounds', 'Aromatization', 'Coal ash', 'Coal combustion', 'Fly ash', 'Gas chromatography', 'Lime', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Oleic acid', 'Phase interfaces', 'Pyrolysis', 'Waste incineration', 'Zeolites', 'Bio oil', 'Fast pyrolysis', 'Pongamia', 'Zeolite X', 'ZSM-5', 'Catalyst selectivity']","['aNational Metal and Materials Technology Center, Thailand Science Park, Klong 1, Klongluang, Pathumthani, 12120, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Japan Science and Technology Agency', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'JST'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Japan International Cooperation Agency', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'JICA'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Metal and Materials Technology Center', 'Funding Number': 'No.MT-B-58-CER-07-308-I', 'Acronym': 'MTEC'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'SATREPS'}]"

Although sepsis is the most common cause of AKI, little is known about sepsis-associated AKD. Methods: Using data from a large randomized trial including 1341 patients with septic shock, we studied patients with stage 2 or 3 AKI on day 1 of hospitalization. We defined AKD as a persistently reduced glomerular filtration rate for >7 days. In addition to clinical data, we measured several urinary biomarkers (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-2∗IGFBP7], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], liver-type fatty acid binding protein, and type 4 collagen) at 0, 6, and 24 hours, to predict AKD. Results: Of 598 patients, 119 (19.9%) died within 7 days, 318 (53.2%) had early reversal of AKI within the first 7 days, whereas 161 (26.9%) developed AKD. In patients with early reversal, 45 (14.2%) had relapsed AKI after early reversal, and only about one-third of these recovered. Among patients developing AKD, only 15 (9.3%) recovered renal function prior to discharge. Male sex, African American race, and underlying CKD were more predominant in patients developing AKD. None of the biomarkers tested performed well for prediction of AKD, although NGAL modestly increased the performance of a clinical model. Conclusions: AKD is common in patients with septic shock, especially among African American males and those with underlying CKD. Existing AKI biomarkers have limited utility for predicting AKD but might be useful together with clinical variables. Novel predictive biomarkers for renal recovery are needed. © 2020 International Society of Nephrology",Kidney International Reports,"{'ISSN': '24680249', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.ekir.2020.03.005', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['acute kidney disease', 'acute kidney injury', 'biomarker', 'predict', 'recovery', 'sepsis', 'collagen type 4', 'insulin like growth factor binding protein 7', 'kidney injury molecule 1', 'liver type fatty acid binding protein', 'neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin', 'somatomedin binding protein', 'tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2', 'unclassified drug', 'acute kidney failure', 'adult', 'African American', 'aged', 'Article', 'body weight', 'chronic kidney failure', 'clinical outcome', 'disease association', 'female', 'human', 'kidney function', 'length of stay', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'pneumonia', 'protein urine level', 'race difference', 'randomized controlled trial (topic)', 'renal replacement therapy', 'sepsis', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score', 'sex difference', 'urinary tract infection']","['aCenter for Critical Care Nephrology, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States', 'bThe CRISMA (Clinical Research, Investigation and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness) Center, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States', 'cExcellence Center for Critical Care Nephrology, Division of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dCritical Care Nephrology Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'eDepartment of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'fUniversity of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL, United States', 'gDepartment of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States', 'hDepartment of Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, United States', 'iRenal Section, Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA, United States', 'jRenal-Electrolyte Division, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States', 'kDepartment of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego, CA, United States', 'lDepartment of Emergency Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'National Institutes of HealthSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NIH', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NIH'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Institute of General Medical SciencesSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NIGMS', 'Funding Number': 'P50 GM076659', 'Acronym': 'NIGMS'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Institute of General Medical SciencesSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NIGMS', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NIGMS'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NIDDK', 'Funding Number': 'R01 DK083961', 'Acronym': 'NIDDK'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesSee opportunities\xa0by\xa0NIDDK', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NIDDK'}]"

Catalytic activity of silver nanoparticles anchored on layered double hydroxides and hydroxyapatite(Article),"['Hoang, T.T.T.L.', 'Insin, N.', 'Sukpirom, N.']","Volume 121, November 2020, Article number 108199","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) embedded on solid supports are promising catalysts due to their high reactivity, stability and selectivity. Herein, we report a facile, efficient and low-cost strategy to anchor AgNPs on layered double hydroxides (LDH) and hydroxyapatite (Hap). The abundant surface hydroxyl groups of Hap and LDH were exploited to form hydrogen bonds with carboxylate-capped AgNPs by simply mixing the preformed substrates and silver suspensions. Spectroscopic and electron microscopic characterization studies revealed the highly dispersed AgNPs on both solid supports. The silver contents in the products obtained were found to depend on the availability of hydroxyl groups in the solid supports. The highest silver content of 6.25 ± 0.15 wt% was achieved when using reconstructed LDH, previously calcined at 450 °C, as a substrate. The rate constants of the 4-nitrophenol reduction catalyzed by Ag/LDH (4 – 6 wt% Ag) were about 2.5 times higher than that of pure AgNPs. The catalytic activity of materials improved with the increase of silver content and reached the maximum at 4 wt% Ag. In addition, the decrease in particle size of AgNPs was another factor to enhance the catalytic activity. © 2020",Inorganic Chemistry Communications,"{'ISSN': '13877003', 'Source Type': 'ICCOF', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.inoche.2020.108199', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['4-nitrophenol reduction', 'Hydrogen bond', 'Hydroxyapatite', 'Layered double hydroxide', 'Silver nanoparticles']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

The purpose of this study was to investigate mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNACN) and inflammatory cytokines in primary knee OA patients and healthy volunteers. A total of 204 knee OA patients and 169 age-matched healthy volunteers were recruited. Their relative blood leukocyte mtDNACNwas assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and ten inflammatory cytokines in their plasma were detected by multiplex immunoassay. Blood leukocyte mtDNACNin the OA group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Leukocyte mtDNACNin the control group was negatively correlated with their age (r=−0.380, P<0.0001), whereas mtDNACNin the OA group was positively correlated with their age (r=0.198, P<0.001). Plasma interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 were significantly higher in the knee OA group than in the control group. The plasma IL-6 level was positively correlated with blood leukocyte mtDNACNin the OA group (r=0.547, P=0.0014). IL-5 showed as a major factor (coefficient 0.69) in the second dimension of principle components analysis (PCA)-transformed data and was significantly higher in the OA group (P<0.001) as well as negatively correlated with mtDNACN(r=−0.577, P<0.001). These findings suggest that elevation of plasma IL-4 and IL-6 and a relative reduction in mtDNACNmight be effective biomarkers for knee OA.

Materials and methods: A total of 31 patients with LSCC with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for EGFR were examined. Digital image processing was applied to analyze EGFR staining intensity and percent distribution, which were calculated as the H-score. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the best cut-off point of EGFR expression, with H-score separated into high- and low-grade for cancer recurrence prediction. Results: The cut-off point of EGFR expression for high- and low-grades was an H-score of 170 with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 66.7%. Using this cut-off, 14 (45.16%) and 17 (54.84%) patients were categorized as having high- and low-grades EGFR, respectively. The analysis showed a significant reverse correlation between the EGFR grade and LSCC recurrence (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.17–0.98; p =.02). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that EGFR grading using H-score with the generated cut-off point by the ROC curve might be further applied as a potential marker for LSCC prognostic prediction. © 2020, © 2020 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).",Acta Oto-Laryngologica,"{'ISSN': '00016489', 'Source Type': 'AOLAA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1080/00016489.2020.1738548', 'Publisher': '32186231'}","['EGFR', 'H-score', 'immunohistochemistry', 'laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma', 'prognostic factor', 'receiver operating characteristic curve', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'tumor marker', 'biological marker', 'EGFR protein, human', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Article', 'cancer grading', 'cancer prognosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'controlled study', 'diagnostic test accuracy study', 'digital imaging', 'female', 'human', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'immunohistochemistry', 'larynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'male', 'priority journal', 'protein expression', 'receiver operating characteristic', 'sensitivity and specificity', 'analysis of variance', 'larynx tumor', 'metabolism', 'prognosis', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck']","['aDepartment of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'GB B_62_006_30_03,GB-CU-61-24-30-14', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'RA59/039', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': ''}]"

The results in this study suggest a number of issues which must be addressed by the researchers and managers. Therefore, assessing the third variable is vital to have a meaningful interpretation of the association among study variables. In a study, if a relationship does not take into account the mediating mechanism, then it fails to get complete understanding of the relationship. In addition, failing to consider the effect of a mediator may not have clear explanation of the relationship outcome. Contrarily, a model which considers the mediating mechanism is likely to estimate accurate relationship among variables under study. Therefore, in order to reach to the legitimate conclusions and decisions, the practitioners and scholars must consider the significance of competitive advantage on performance and intellectual capital (CAP) nexus.

Financial Impact Assessment of Construction Delay in BOT Infrastructure Projects(Conference Paper),"['Kasemsukh, S.', 'Kokkaew, N.']","2020, Pages 425-434","In Thailand, a PPP arrangement called build-operate-transfer or BOT is commonly employed for large-scale infrastructure projects. The life cycle of BOT arrangement can be divided into three phases: the design phase, the construction phase, and the operation phase. In this paper, the focus is on the construction phase since it appears to be the phase with the highest level of risk. Several studies have also found that many large-scale infrastructure projects experienced a chronic problem of construction delay, some of which even led to contract termination. In a PPP setting, the consequences of construction delay can be more acute and thus worth studying. The objective of this research is therefore to evaluate financial impacts resulting from construction delay. Financial model of a hypothetical BOT infrastructure project will be employed in this study. Risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation will also be performed in order to identify level of risk exposed by the project sponsor. The results of this study may provide an insight into how construction risk shall be mitigated and managed by both the public sector and the private sector so as to create a fair and robust BOT contract in the future. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"{'ISSN': '978-078448323-7', 'Source Type': 'Conference Proceeding', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1061/9780784483237.051', 'Publisher': 'Conference Paper'}","['Apartment houses', 'Finance', 'Intelligent buildings', 'Life cycle', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'Office buildings', 'Project management', 'Risk analysis', 'Risk assessment', 'Sustainable development', 'Technology transfer', 'Build operate transfers', 'Construction delays', 'Construction phase', 'Construction risks', 'Financial impacts', 'Financial modeling', 'Infrastructure project', 'Large scale infrastructures', 'Construction']","['Dept. of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn Univ., Bangkok, Thailand']",[]

Dynamics of microbial diversity during processing and its contribution to the flavor of shrimp paste was investigated by next generation sequencing. Bacteria containing aminopeptidase genes were analyzed to present the possibility relating to taste-enhancing di- and tripeptide generation. Furthermore, this study showed the difference of microbial community structure in shrimp pastes collected from various regions in Thailand. The microbial diversity structure dramatically changed from the raw materials since the first step of processing. Salimicrobium spp. (53.6%) and Salinicoccus spp. (44.0%) were the major population; however, they were decreasing during processing. Alkalibacterium, Macrococcus caseolyticus, Jeotgalicoccus psychophillus, and Staphylococcus spp. became visible. M. caseolyticus and J. psychrophilus were detected as the first time in shrimp paste products. Then in one-month fermented sample, Lentibacillus spp. was 3.3%. Although, as per our experimentation (water activity, salt and pH), we could not observe any significant difference among different products. In two-month fermented sample, Lentibacillus spp. was solely the most abundant microorganism. From aminopeptidase genes analysis, the abundance of Salinococcus spp. during preparation and Lentibacillus spp. during fermentation may relate to good flavor quality of shrimp paste. © 2019",LWT,"{'ISSN': '00236438', 'Source Type': 'LBWTA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108989', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Fermented food', 'Fishery product', 'Microbial diversity', 'Microbiota', 'Shrimp paste', 'Genes', 'Microorganisms', 'Fermented foods', 'Fishery product', 'Microbial diversity', 'Microbiotas', 'Shrimp paste', 'Shellfish']","['aProgram in Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bCenter of Excellence in Natural Products, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Food Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, 108-8477, Japan', 'dNouveau Centric Co.Ltd, 55 Soi Chatsanuea-Watthana-Sakun 19/4 Phatthanakan Road, Suan Luang, Bangkok, 10250, Thailand', 'eResearch and Development Center, Betagro Group, Klong Luang, Pathumthani  10120, Thailand', 'fDepartment of Food Technology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'CF5803230', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'PHD60I0018', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}]"

In this large-scale survey of Halal-certified food products randomly collected from markets in Thailand, 4,829 food samples from 10 food groups were tested in the laboratory for four potentially Haram substances: porcine DNA, porcine fatty acids, ethanol, and hydroxyproline (gelatin). No samples were adulterated with porcine DNA or fatty acids. However, 62 samples (approximately 1.3%) were positive for ethanol (>0.5% for non–naturally fermented products and >1% for naturally fermented products). The hydroxyproline concentration in the samples was compared with that of a negative control. Gelatin, as indicated by the presence of hydroxyproline, was the major suspicious substance found in these products. Further investigations are required to determine whether the gelatin is of Halal origin. These results from this first large-scale postmarket surveillance of Halal-certified food products for forbidden substances reveals the important role of forensic laboratory testing for supporting Halal supervision and certification.

In 2018, an episode of severe mortality in juvenile barramundi was noted in a freshwater earth pond site. Fish presented with severe gill necrosis, as well as severe cutaneous hemorrhages, scale loss, and discoloration at the base of dorsal fin (saddleback lesions). Histopathology revealed extensive necrosis of skeletal muscle and gill filaments, as well as basophilic inclusion bodies and megalocytosis in muscle, gill, liver, and kidney. Scale drop disease virus (SDDV) infection was subsequently confirmed by virus-specific semi-nested PCR. Further, DNA sequences of the viral major capsid protein (MCP) and ATPase genes had a respective homology of 99.85 and 99.92% with sequences of SDDV infecting barramundi in saltwater culture. Gill necrosis and saddleback lesions are not typical lesions associated with scale drop syndrome. Their presence was explained by Flavobacterium columnare isolation from the gill, followed by positive F. columnare-specific PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SDDV-associated mortality in freshwater-farmed barramundi.

Main methods: We screened and compared the gene expression profiles obtained by RNA sequencing, of CCA cells cultured in high and normal glucose. Results from the transcriptomic analysis were confirmed in additional cell lines using in vitro migration-invasion assay, Western blotting and immunocytofluorescence. Key findings: Data indicated that high glucose increased the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an upstream regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, through the nuclear localization of NF-κB. High glucose-induced NF-κB increased the migration and invasion of CCA cells and the expression of downstream NF-κB targeted genes associated with aggressiveness, including interleukin-6, a potent triggering signal of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Such effects were reversed by inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation which additionally reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705. Significance: These results indicate that NF-κB is activated by high glucose and they suggest that NF-κB interaction with STAT3 enhances CCA aggressiveness. Therefore, targeting multiple pathways such as STAT3 and NF-κB might improve CCA treatment outcome especially in condition such as hyperglycemia. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Life Sciences,"{'ISSN': '00243205', 'Source Type': 'LIFSA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118548', 'Publisher': '33038372'}","['Biliary tract cancer', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'High glucose', 'Interleukin-1β', 'Nuclear factor-κB', 'STAT3', 'Transcriptomics', 'glucose', 'immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein', 'interleukin 1beta', 'interleukin 6', 'STAT3 protein', 'immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein', 'interleukin 1beta', 'STAT3 protein', 'STAT3 protein, human', 'Article', 'bile duct carcinoma', 'cancer cell culture', 'carcinogenesis', 'cell invasion', 'cell migration', 'cholangiocarcinoma cell line', 'controlled study', 'fluorescence', 'gene expression', 'genetic association', 'human', 'human cell', 'immunocytochemistry', 'in vitro study', 'NF KB gene', 'phenotype', 'protein phosphorylation', 'RNA sequencing', 'STAT3 gene', 'transcriptomics', 'Western blotting', 'bile duct cancer', 'bile duct carcinoma', 'cell motion', 'gene expression regulation', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'pathology', 'physiology', 'tumor cell line', 'tumor invasion', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'NF-kappa B', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor']","['aDepartment of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand', 'bCholangiocarcinoma Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand', 'cHuman Genome Sequencing Center, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX  77030, United States', 'dThe Center of Excellence in Systems Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eDepartment of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, 480-1195, Japan', 'fDepartment of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand', 'gMichael E.

Aims of the study were to evaluate the pedobarography and ankle kinematics of the clubfoot post-surgery and compare with controls. Methods: Twenty-two patients (33 clubfeet) and 22 normal children (44 feet) were enrolled into the cross-sectional study. Demographic data were recorded. Plantar force measurements and ankle kinematic data were obtained and compared between clubfoot patients and controls by pedobarography and 3-dimensional gait analysis. Results: Clubfoot patients were operated at an average age of 12.8 ± 8.1 months. The average follow-up was 9.9 ± 3.9 years. Demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The plantar force in clubfoot patients was significantly lower than controls (108.2 ± 86.7 vs. 150.9 ± 73.9 N, p = 0.03). Clubfoot patients demonstrated a longer contact time, larger contact area, lower peak pressure, and force relative to body weight in toe, midfoot, and heel areas. The impulse was comparable between the two groups but the contact area, force, and force time integral concentrated at the midfoot region of the clubfoot. The ankle kinematics in clubfoot patients demonstrated a dorsiflexed position through late toe off. Range of dorsiflexion in the clubfoot was significantly higher than in controls. Foot adduction during stance, limited inversion-eversion, and limited plantar flexion during loading response and toe off were observed. Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of limited soft tissue release during clubfoot surgery. Although the procedure could preserve range of motion at the ankle joint, muscle weakness and flatfoot deformity are prevalent. © 2019, SICOT aisbl.",International Orthopaedics,"{'ISSN': '03412695', 'Source Type': 'IORTD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s00264-019-04447-2', 'Publisher': '31796992'}","['Clubfoot', 'Gait analysis', 'Surgery', 'Tenotomy', 'Treatment outcome', 'abduction', 'adduction', 'adolescent', 'adult', 'ankle', 'Article', 'biomechanics', 'child', 'clinical article', 'clinical evaluation', 'clinical observation', 'clubfoot', 'cohort analysis', 'comparative study', 'contact time', 'controlled study', 'cross-sectional study', 'dorsiflexion', 'dorsiplantar flexion', 'eversion', 'female', 'follow up', 'foot', 'gait', 'heel', 'human', 'inversion', 'joint characteristics and functions', 'kinematics', 'male', 'midfoot', 'muscle strength', 'musculoskeletal manipulation', 'musculoskeletal system examination', 'pediatric patient', 'pedobarography', 'plantar flexion', 'priority journal', 'range of motion', 'soft tissue release', 'stance time', 'standing', 'step length', 'stride length', 'stride width', 'swing time', 'toe', 'walking parameters', 'walking speed', 'weight bearing', 'adverse event', 'ankle', 'case control study', 'clubfoot', 'diagnostic imaging', 'foot joint', 'infant', 'orthopedic surgery', 'pathophysiology', 'physiology', 'postoperative period', 'preschool child', 'pressure', 'procedures', 'three-dimensional imaging', 'Ankle', 'Ankle Joint', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clubfoot', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Foot Joints', 'Gait', 'Gait Analysis', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Postoperative Period', 'Pressure', 'Range of Motion, Articular']","['aDepartment of Orthopaedics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bBangbuathong Hospital, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, 11110, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Orthopaedics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'RA 61/102', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': ''}]"

Data were obtained from 265 students from years 2, 4 and 6. Results: Three critical dimensions of dental student's preferences were revealed. First, socially related goals were identified as important for developing healthcare innovation. Second, non-traditional learning activities, especially lectures from experienced innovators or an industrial trip were suggested to foster interest in healthcare innovation. Third, the students thought it was important to learn about the research process that translates scientific findings into healthcare innovation. Conclusions: This study identifies potential ways to develop dental clinicians’ interest in becoming innovative professionals who are involved in healthcare product development. This is especially true for Thailand where commercially based innovation has not yet flourished. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Twisted compactifications of 6D field theories from maximal 7D gauged supergravity(Article)(Open Access),"['Karndumri, P.', 'Nuchino, P.']","Volume 80, Issue 3, 1 March 2020, Article number 201","We study supersymmetric AdSn× Σ7-n, n= 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 solutions in seven-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity with CSO(p, q, 5 - p- q) and CSO(p, q, 4 - p- q) gauge groups. These gauged supergravities are consistent truncations of eleven-dimensional supergravity and type IIB theory on Hp,q∘ T5-p-qand Hp,q∘ T4-p-q, respectively. Apart from recovering the previously known AdSn× Σ7-nsolutions in SO(5) gauge group, we find novel classes of AdS5× S2, AdS3× S2× Σ2and AdS3× CP2solutions in non-compact SO(3, 2) gauge group together with a class of AdS3× CP2solutions in SO(4, 1) gauge group. In SO(5) gauge group, we extensively study holographic RG flow solutions interpolating from the SO(5) supersymmetric AdS7vacuum to the AdSn× Σ7-nfixed points and singular geometries in the form of curved domain walls with Mkwn-1× Σ7-nslices. In many cases, the singularities are physically acceptable and can be interpreted as non-conformal phases of (n- 1) -dimensional SCFTs obtained from twisted compactifications of N= (2 , 0) SCFT in six dimensions. In SO(3, 2) and SO(4, 1) gauge groups, we give a large number of RG flows between the new AdSn× Σ7-nfixed points and curved domain walls while, in CSO(p, q, 4 - p- q) gauge group, RG flows interpolating between asymptotically locally flat domain walls and curved domain walls are given. © 2020, The Author(s).",European Physical Journal C,"{'ISSN': '14346044', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7752-x', 'Publisher': 'Article'}",[],"['String Theory and Supergravity Group, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phayathai Road, Bangkok, Pathumwan  10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'RSA6280022', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}]"

vector-like top quark partner T of charge 2/3 in association with a top or bottom quark, using proton-proton collision data at s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The search targets T quarks over a wide range of masses and fractional widths, decaying to a top quark and either a Higgs boson or a Z boson in fully hadronic final states. The search is performed using two experimentally distinct signatures that depend on whether or not each quark from the decays of the top quark, Higgs boson, or Z boson produces an individual resolved jet. Jet substructure, b tagging, and kinematic variables are used to identify the top quark and boson jets, and also to suppress the standard model backgrounds. The data are found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross sections for T quark-mediated production of tHQq, tZQq, and their sum, where Q is the associated top or bottom heavy quark and q is another associated quark. The limits are given for each search signature for various T quark widths up to 30% of the T quark mass, and are between 2 pb and 20 fb for T quark masses in the range 0.6–2.6 TeV. These results are significantly more sensitive than prior searches for electroweak single production of T → tH and represent the first constraints on T → tZ using hadronic decays of the Z boson with this production mode.

Development of encoded Broccoli RNA aptamers for live cell imaging of alphavirus genomic and subgenomic RNAs(Article)(Open Access),"['Nilaratanakul, V.', 'Hauer, D.A.', 'Griffin, D.E.']","Volume 10, Issue 1, 1 December 2020, Article number 5233","Sindbis virus (SINV) can infect neurons and cause encephalomyelitis in mice. Nonstructural proteins are translated from genomic RNA and structural proteins from subgenomic RNA. While visualization of viral proteins in living cells is well developed, imaging of viral RNAs has been challenging. RNA aptamers that bind and activate conditional fluorophores provide a tool for RNA visualization. We incorporated cassettes of two F30-scaffolded dimers of the Broccoli aptamer into a SINV cDNA clone using sites in nsP3 (genomic RNA), the 3′UTR (genomic and subgenomic RNAs) and after a second subgenomic promoter resulting in 4–28 Broccoli copies. After addition of the cell-permeable 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI-1T) conditional fluorophore and laser excitation, infected cells emitted green fluorescence that correlated with Broccoli copy numbers. All recombinant viruses replicated well in BHK and undifferentiated neural cells but viruses with 14 or more Broccoli copies were attenuated in differentiated neurons and mice. The signal survived fixation and allowed visualization of viral RNAs in differentiated neurons and mouse brain, as well as BHK cells. Subgenomic RNA was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with genomic RNA also in perinuclear vesicle-like structures near envelope glycoproteins or mitochondria. Broccoli aptamer-tagging provides a valuable tool for live cell imaging of viral RNA. © 2020, The Author(s).",Scientific Reports,"{'ISSN': '20452322', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1038/s41598-020-61573-3', 'Publisher': '32251299'}","['3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone', 'aptamer', 'benzyl derivative', 'fluorescent dye', 'imidazoline derivative', 'plant RNA', 'virus RNA', ""3' untranslated region"", 'animal', 'brain', 'Brassica', 'C57BL mouse', 'cell differentiation', 'cell line', 'cell survival', 'chemistry', 'cytology', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'genetics', 'hamster', 'molecular imaging', 'nerve cell', 'physiology', 'procedures', 'Sindbis virus', 'transgenic microorganism', 'virology', 'virus replication', ""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Benzyl Compounds', 'Brain', 'Brassica', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Imidazolines', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Neurons', 'RNA, Plant', 'RNA, Viral', 'Sindbis Virus', 'Virus Replication']","['aW.

"Machine hermeneutics, postphenomenology, and facial recognition technology(Article)","['Hongladarom, S.']","Volume 38, Issue 6, December 2023, Pages 2151-2158","I would like to introduce the notion of machine hermeneutics in this paper. The notion refers to hermeneutical activity performed by machines. Machines are now capable of making the very interpretive tasks, using artificial intelligence algorithms based on the technology of machine learning that used to be the exclusive domain of human beings. In making this claim, I am not talking about possible conscious machines of the future, but those existing here and now. With facial recognition algorithms, for example, machines are now performing routinely what must be regarded as hermeneutical analyses with astounding accuracy and power. Thus, machine hermeneutics supplements Don Ihde’s notion of material hermeneutics. In the latter, it is still human beings who do the interpretation, through the lenses provided the natural sciences; in this case, the natural sciences, or the technology afforded by the sciences, intervene between the human being and the world. In machine hermeneutics, on the contrary, the intervening comes in two layers. On the one hand, there is the usual intervention that Ihde talks about, but on the other, the artificial intelligence algorithm performs its own kind of intervention and interpretation, presenting an already interpreted result to the human beings, who then perceive it through the aid of the usual intervention such as the normal eyeglasses. Then the paper discusses the problem of how to justify the kind of perception that undergoes this process. In what sense can it be said that the algorithm is performing the right action, i.e., one such that the process comes up with a right picture of the world? I contend that this does not merely consist of technical excellence for the technology involved, but also ethical excellence. The two cannot be considered one apart from the other. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",AI and Society,"{'ISSN': '09515666', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s00146-020-00951-x', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Artificial intelligence', 'Don Ihde', 'Machine hermeneutics', 'Material hermeneutics', 'Perception', 'Ethical technology', 'Face recognition', 'Artificial intelligence algorithms', 'Conscious machines', 'Don ihde', 'Facial recognition', 'Human being', 'Machine hermeneutic', 'Machine-learning', 'Material hermeneutic', 'Power', 'Recognition algorithm', 'Machine learning']","['Department of Philosophy and Center for Ethics of Science and Technology, Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and incidence of atrial fibrillation: A meta-analysis(Article)(Open Access),"['Chokesuwattanaskul, R.', 'Chiengthong, K.', 'Thongprayoon, C.', 'Lertjitbanjong, P.', 'Bathini, T.', 'Ungprasert, P.', 'Cato, L.D.', 'Mao, M.A.', 'Cheungpasitporn, W.']","Volume 113, Issue 2, 1 February 2020, Pages 79-85","Background: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for many inflammatory disorders and pain-related illnesses. Despite their widespread use, the association between NSAIDs and the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate this association. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception through August 2019 to identify studies that evaluated the risk of AF among patients using NSAIDs. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42019141609). Results: Eight observational studies (four case-control studies and four cohort studies) with a total of 14 806 420 patients were enrolled. When compared with nonNSAIDs users, the pooled RR of AF in patients with NSAIDs use was 1.29 (95% CI 1.19-1.39). Meta-analyses based on the type of study were additionally performed. Subgroup analysis by study design revealed a significant association between the use of NSAIDs and AF for both case-control studies (pooled RR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15-1.63) and cohort studies (pooled RR 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31). Sub-analyses based on specific NSAIDs showed pooled RRs of AF in patients using ibuprofen of 1.30 (95% CI 1.22-1.39), naproxen of 1.44 (95% CI 1.18-1.76) and diclofenac of 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.71), respectively.

Additive manufacturing of metals: A review(Conference Paper),"['Herderick, E.']","Volume 2, 2011, Pages 1413-1425","Over the past 20 years, additive manufacturing (AM) has evolved from 3D printers used for rapid prototyping to sophisticated rapid manufacturing that can create parts directly without the use of tooling. AM technologies build near net shape components layer by layer using 3D model data. AM could revolutionize many sectors of manufacturing by reducing component lead time, material waste, energy usage, and carbon footprint. Furthermore, AM has the potential to enable novel product designs that could not be fabricated using conventional processes. This proceedings is a review that assesses available AM technologies for direct metal fabrication. Included is an outline of the definition of AM, a review of the commercially available and under development technologies for direct metal fabrication, possibilities, and an overall assessment of the state of the art. Perspective on future research opportunities is also be presented.

Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p <.001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p <.001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.

It is structurally dominated by NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW trending normal faults as a result of multistage rifting since the Late Oligocene. Half-graben and full-graben basin geometries can be observed from 2D regional seismic sections. In this study, structural restoration techniques were applied to validate the structural interpretation of the original hardcopy of the 2D seismic sections. Stratigraphic information is compiled from published papers and well reports. Our results revealed that most of the deformation was concentrated during the Late Oligocene. Main depocenters for the syn-rift sediments focused in the basin center along the west-dipping normal faults. These faults cut the prerift section and their orientations were possibly controlled by the Permo-Triassic fabrics that underlie the Phetchabun Basin. By measuring the length of the profiles before and after faulting, the restorations show that the extensions of the Wichianburi Subbasin decrease from 12.30% during the main rift phase (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) to 2.53% during the second phase of rifting. Rifting only focused in the basin center with the development of NNW-SSE to N-S trending intrarift faults. Since the Middle Miocene, the Wichianburi Subbasin has developed under the tectonic phase of post-rift subsidence with interruption by intrusive activities. © Copyright © 2020 Jitmahantakul, Phetheet and Kanjanapayont.",Frontiers in Earth Science,"{'ISSN': '22966463', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.3389/feart.2020.578218', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Cenozoic basin', 'Phetchabun Basin', 'structural restoration', 'Thailand', 'Wichianburi Sub-basin', 'Restoration', 'Seismology', 'Stratigraphy', 'Basin evolution', 'Early Miocene', 'Late Oligocene', 'Middle Miocene', 'Permo-Triassic', 'Seismic sections', 'Structural interpretation', 'Structural restorations', 'Fault slips', 'basin evolution', 'Cenozoic', 'normal fault', 'rifting', 'structural geology', 'two-dimensional modeling', 'Northern Region [Thailand]', 'Phetchabun', 'Thailand']","['aBasin Analysis and Structural Evolution Research Unit (BASE RU), Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bM.Sc.

The impacts of collective threshold requirements for rewards in a CPR experiment(Article),"['Tambunlertchai, K.', 'Pongkijvorasin, S.']","Volume 22, Issue 4, 1 October 2020, Pages 537-554","Rewards for desirable behavior are increasingly being adopted in many regulatory settings. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on how rewards should best be crafted to achieve desired results. This paper focuses on the issue of regulatory design in the context of forest management in Thailand. We run lab-in-field experiments using a common-pool-resource game with villagers in northern Thailand. We study the impacts of varying the collective threshold for obtaining economic rewards on resource extraction, distribution of payoffs and cost efficiency. Three thresholds are studied—strict, moderate, and relaxed, corresponding to low, moderate, and generous targets for group extraction accordingly. We find that rewards are associated with positive conservation outcomes and that their effectiveness depends on the design of the reward instrument. In our setting, strict and moderate thresholds lead to the greatest gains in conservation but differ in important ways. The strict threshold leads to cost efficiency but induces free-riding behavior. The moderate threshold is not as cost-efficient but allows for a more equitable payoffs distribution. The relaxed threshold does not lead to any gain in conservation and is the least cost-efficient. Increasing the reward size can induce a faster achievement of the equilibrium outcome. © 2020, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,"{'ISSN': '1432847X', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s10018-020-00268-5', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Collective threshold', 'Common-pool resource', 'Experiment', 'Payments', 'Reward size']","['Faculty of Economics, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'EEPSEA'}]"
Solvent-based washing as a treatment alternative for onshore petroleum drill cuttings in Thailand(Article),"['Poyai, T.', 'Getwech, C.', 'Dhanasin, P.', 'Punyapalakul, P.', 'Painmanakul, P.', 'Chawaloesphonsiya, N.']","Volume 718, 20 May 2020, Article number 137384","In Thailand, onshore drill cuttings (DC) contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) are currently transported off-site for incineration, causing high transportation cost and potential leakage to the environment. To address the issues, we develop solvent-based washing as a greener alternative for onshore DC remediation, focusing on solvent selection, washing process optimization, and solvent recovery. The results showed that ethyl lactate (EL) was the best green solvent for DC washing, compared to water, ethylene glycol, and ethyl acetate. Based on response surface methodology assisted with central composite design, the maximum TPH removal of 87.1% was achieved from 4 mL g−1liquid-to-solid ratio, 14 min washing time, and 80 rpm stirring speed, and the TPH removal rate by EL fitted well with the second-order reaction (R2= 0.9774). Furthermore, the spent EL was successfully recycled by simple and low-energy adsorption using granular activated carbon (GAC). With the sufficient GAC dosage, TPH could be completely removed from the spent EL without impairing the original EL properties. Moreover, the recycled EL exhibited its successful reuse in the subsequent DC washing process. These findings suggest that solvent washing accompanied with solvent recovery by adsorption could be a novel and greener remedial scheme for onshore DC management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,"{'ISSN': '00489697', 'Source Type': 'STEVA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137384', 'Publisher': '32105921'}","['Drill cuttings', 'Green solvents', 'Optimization', 'Solvent recovery', 'Total petroleum hydrocarbon', 'Activated carbon', 'Activated carbon treatment', 'Ethylene', 'Ethylene glycol', 'Gasoline', 'Incineration', 'Infill drilling', 'Optimization', 'Petroleum transportation', 'Recycling', 'Rock drills', 'Washing', 'Central composite designs', 'Drill cuttings', 'Granular activated carbons', 'Green solvents', 'Liquid to solid ratio', 'Response surface methodology', 'Solvent recovery', 'Total petroleum hydrocarbons', 'Organic solvents', 'acetic acid ethyl ester', 'activated carbon', 'ethylene glycol', 'hydrocarbon', 'lactic acid ethyl ester', 'petroleum', 'water', 'activated carbon', 'adsorption', 'cutting (excavation)', 'optimization', 'petroleum hydrocarbon', 'remediation', 'response surface methodology', 'solvent', 'adsorption', 'Article', 'chemical reaction', 'controlled study', 'cost', 'drill cutting', 'ecosystem restoration', 'green chemistry', 'incineration', 'industrial waste', 'oil industry', 'priority journal', 'process optimization', 'recycling', 'response surface method', 'Thailand', 'traffic and transport', 'waste management', 'Thailand']","['aInternational Program in Hazardous Substance and Environmental Management, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bCenter of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management (HSM), Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cPTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP), Bangkok, 10900, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'eResearch Unit on Technology for Oil Spill and Contamination Management, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'fResearch Program on Remediation Technologies for Petroleum Contamination, Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management (HSM), Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

This study aimed to determine the rate of congenital syphilis and identify gaps in prevention. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted in a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand. The study included all pregnant women with positive syphilis serology and their infants. All congenital syphilis cases were categorized according to Centers for Disease Control criteria. Results: From 2013 to 2017, 69 syphilis-infected pregnant women were included, with 30 congenital syphilis cases. The rate of congenital syphilis was 115 cases (95% CI 78–164) per 100 000 live births. The median (interquartile range) maternal age was 21 (18–32) years and 12 (17%) women had human immunodeficiency virus co-infection. Regarding maternal treatment, 28 (41%) women had inadequate treatment due to 13 cases (19%) of late or no antenatal care, six cases (8%) of recent infection near delivery, five cases (7%) of failure of treatment provision, and four (6%) others. There were three syphilitic stillbirths who were prematurely born to untreated pregnant women and 67 live births (one set of twins) of which 27 met definitions of probable congenital syphilis. They received complete treatment with penicillin and had non-reactive rapid plasma reagin within the first 6 months of life, with the exception of one who had non-reactive rapid plasma reagin at the age of 7 months. Conclusions: Congenital syphilis remains a problem in our setting. Nearly half of pregnant women who had syphilis had inadequate treatment.

Decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions of the manufacturing and industrial sector in Thailand(Article)(Open Access),"['Chontanawat, J.', 'Wiboonchutikula, P.', 'Buddhivanich, A.']","Volume 13, Issue 4, 2020, Article number 798","Since the 1990s, CO2emissions have increased steadily in line with the growth of production and the use of energy in the manufacturing sector in Thailand. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Method is used for analysing the sources of changes in CO2emissions as well as the CO2emission intensity of the sector in 2000–2018. On average throughout the period, both the amount of CO2emissions and the CO2emission intensity increased each year relative to the baseline. The structural change effect (effect of changes of manufacturing production composition) reduced, but the intensity effect (effect of changes of CO2emissions of individual industries) increased the amount of CO2emissions and the CO2emission intensity. The unfavourable CO2emission intensity change came from the increased energy intensity of individual industries. The increased use of coal and electricity raised the CO2emissions, whereas the insignificant change in emission factors showed little impact. Therefore, the study calls for policies that decrease the energy intensity of each industry by limiting the use of coal and reducing the electricity used by the manufacturing sector so that Thailand can make a positive contribution to the international community’s effort to achieve the goal of CO2emissions reduction. © 2020 by the authors.",Energies,"{'ISSN': '19961073', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.3390/en13040798', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Carbon emissions', 'Decomposition', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Thailand', 'Carbon', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Coal industry', 'Decomposition', 'Emission control', 'Carbon emissions', 'Decomposition analysis', 'Divisia index method', 'Emission factors', 'Industrial sector', 'International community', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Thailand', 'Manufacture']","['aDepartment of Social Sciences and Humanities, School of Liberal Arts, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, 10140, Thailand', 'bFaculty of Economics, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cBureau of Industrial Sectors Development, Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand, 1st-2nd Fl., Bangkok, 10110, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'School of Liberal Arts', 'Funding Number': 'ICEER 2019', 'Acronym': 'SLA'}, {'Funding Sponsor': ""King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi"", 'Funding Number': '2562102,T630042', 'Acronym': 'KMUTT'}]"
Economic Analysis of Swine Farm Management for the Enhancement of Biogas Production and Energy Efficiency(Article),"['Putmai, N.', 'Jarunglumlert, T.', 'Prommuak, C.', 'Pavasant, P.', 'Flood, A.E.']","Volume 11, Issue 10, 1 October 2020, Pages 5635-5645","Abstract: The conventional all-in/all-out batch management that is applied in most small to medium swine farms often provides an inconsistent feed of wastewater to biogas systems, causing an imbalance between the power requirements and generation capacity of a farm. This study proposes two alternative models that can be employed to ease this problem. In Model 1, the operation was divided into two offset batch intervals, while in Model 2, the operation used four separate offset batch intervals. The models developed here help avoid an unnecessary long lag phase in the digester, allowing more stable anaerobic digestion performance and more evenly distributed biogas production. Accordingly, the models produce a more stable supply of energy for domestic use, achieving a 36–44% reduction in the electricity expense or a savings of 43,782 m3biogas/year or 35,834 kWh equivalent compared with that of conventional management. Conventional farm management has periods of excess and deficient biogas production; excess biogas is produced at a rate of up to 14,714 m3/year or 12,043 kWh equivalent at the peak period. This excess could be reduced by 79–100% by using the proposed farming models. This reduction is equivalent to greenhouse gas reductions of 9441 and 11,902 m3CO2eq./year by Models 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is used to show how the profitability of biogas plants would vary due to changes in some key parameters, such as the electricity buyback price. The results suggest that more profit could be attained from a significant reduction in operating costs by proper farm management without requiring additional investment.

A designed wearable balance assistance device which consists of scissored-pair control moment gyroscopes and a two-axis inclination sensor is introduced to reduce fall risk from excessive sway among the elderly. The prototype has dimensions of H50cm × W44cm × D30cm and weighs 15.03 kg. This study aims to investigate the effects of generated torque of the prototype on human subjects and aims to determine if the two-axis inclination sensor can detect sway amplitude and sway direction during an occurrence of excessive sway. Two healthy male subjects participated in the study. According to the results, the detected body incline angle related to the acquired sway amplitude of COP trajectories with correlation factors of 0.92 and 0.88 for the two subjects. The detected sway angle related to the acquired sway direction of COP trajectories with the correlation factors of 0.99 and 0.98 for the two subjects. The maximum-allowable generated torque of the prototype with an assigned actuating angle varying within ±15.6° from the acquired sway direction of COP trajectories was able to drive the COP of 60-kilogram-weighted healthy subject maintaining balance at posterolateral limits of stability with an average body incline angle of 5.74° to pass his standing secure zone.

Crocetin suppresses the growth and migration in HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells by activating the p-38 MAPK signaling pathway(Article)(Open Access),"['Khajeh, E.', 'Rasmi, Y.', 'Kheradmand, F.', 'Malekinejad, H.', 'Aramwit, P.', 'Saboory, E.', 'Daeihassani, B.', 'Nasirzadeh, M.']","Volume 15, Issue 6, 1 November 2020, Pages 592-601","Background and purpose: Crocetin is a natural antioxidant that is found in the crocus flower and Gardenia jasminoides (fruit). Previous studies have reported its anticancer activity both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, crocetin suppresses the growth and migration of human colorectal cancer cells, however, its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study investigated the molecular mechanism of crocetin effect on colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116) in vitro. Experimental approach: HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 μM) of crocetin for 24 h. The cell survival rate was measured by MTT assay. Cell migration capacity was evaluated using the wound healing assay. The expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) was monitored by RT-PCR. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was determined using western blot. Findings/Results: The proliferation of HCT-116 was inhibited by crocetin at 800 μM (P < 0.001). Crocetin prevented migration of HCT-116 cells (P < 0.05) and suppressed VEGF and MMP-9 mRNA expression (P < 0.001) and increased phosphorylation of p38 (MAPK; P < 0.001). However, no significant change in the phosphorylation of FAK was observed.

Robotic and automation technologies are now complementing farmers in various ways. In this paper, we present the mechanical and electrical design of multi-purpose agricultural robot which has the capabilities to move in three Cartesian coordinate axis along with the functionality of harvesting small sized fruits with the help of grippers. Our developed robot prototype can be controlled via remote control. Prototype testing results show that the developed robot can reach to the target by passing any small sized obstacle and harvest the fruit.

"Integrative taxonomy of the new millipede genus Coxobolellus, gen. nov. (Diplopoda: Spirobolida: Pseudospirobolellidae), with descriptions of ten new species(Article)(Open Access)","['Pimvichai, P.', 'Enghoff, H.', 'Panha, S.', 'Backeljau, T.']","Volume 34, Issue 6, 14 August 2020, Pages 591-617","Pseudospirobolellidae is a poorly known family of spirobolidan millipedes with only two genera and five described species. Yet, the descriptive taxonomy and molecular systematics of this group have been largely neglected. Therefore, the present work presents an integrative taxonomic study of new pseudospirobolellid taxa in Thailand. To this end, two mitochondrial gene fragments (COI and 16S rRNA) combined with morphological characters were used to define the genus Coxobolellus, gen. nov. with 10 new species, viz. C. albiceps, sp. nov., C. compactogonus, sp. nov., C. fuscus, sp. nov., C. nodosus, sp. nov., C. serratus, sp. nov., C. simplex, sp. nov., C. tenebris, sp. nov., C. tigris, sp. nov., C. transversalis, sp. nov. and C. valvatus, sp. nov. The interspecific COI sequence divergences among the new species ranged from 6 to 15%. The intergeneric COI sequence divergence between species of Coxobolellus, gen. nov., Benoitolus birgitae and Pseudospirobolellus sp. ranged from 20 to 23%. Three major morphological differences separate Coxobolellus, gen. nov. from Benoitolus and Pseudospirobolellus, namely (1) the protruding process on the 3rd (and 4th) coxae on male legs, (2) the posterior gonopod telopodite divided into two parts, and (3) a conspicuous opening pore at the mesal margin at the end of the coxal part of the posterior gonopod. Thus, the new genus is well supported by both mtDNA and morphological evidence, while the delimitation of the 10 new species is supported by the congruence between mtDNA and morphological data. Yet, with respect to the relationships of Benoitolus birgitae, morphological data suggest a similarity with Coxobolellus, gen. nov. and Pseudospirobolellus, whereas mtDNA data place this species in the Pachybolidae. Further phylogenetic analyses are needed to explore this apparent incongruence and test the monophyly of Pseudospirobolellidae. © 2020 CSIRO.",Invertebrate Systematics,"{'ISSN': '14455226', 'Source Type': 'ISNYA', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1071/IS20031', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['mitochondrial DNA', 'new genus', 'phylogeny', 'species delineation', 'divergence', 'mitochondrion', 'morphology', 'new genus', 'new species', 'taxonomy', 'Thailand', 'Diplopoda', 'Pachybolidae', 'Pseudospirobolellidae', 'Pseudospirobolellus', 'Spirobolida']","['aDepartment of Biology, Faculty of Science, Mahasarakham University, Mahasarakham, 44150, Thailand', 'bNatural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 15, Copenhagen Ø, DK-2100, Denmark', 'cAnimal Systematics Research Unit, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'dRoyal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Vautierstraat 29, Brussels, B-1000, Belgium', 'eEvolutionary Ecology Group, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, Antwerp, B-2610, Belgium']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'RSA6280051', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Science Research and Innovation', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'TSRI'}]"

Absorption kinetics of CO2in novel formulated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and N-methyl-4-piperidinol solvent(Article)(Open Access),"['Sema, T.', 'Ranong, P.N.', 'Kiattinirachara, T.', 'Posoknistakul, P.', 'Jiraratananon, R.', 'Tontiwachwuthikul, P.']","Volume 6, November 2020, Pages 143-150","In the present study, kinetics of CO2absorption in novel formulated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and N-methyl-4-piperidinol (MPDL) solvent was investigated in a stirred tank reactor over ranges of temperature (303–333 K) and concentration (5% wt. AMP-25% wt. MPDL, 10% wt. AMP-20% wt. MPDL, and 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL). A drop of pressure method was used to determine the kinetics of CO2absorption in terms of overall reaction kinetics constant (kov) through a slope of the drop of pressure plot. It was found that the kovincreased as temperature increased and increased as concentration of AMP in AMP-MPDL solvent increased over ranges of studied temperature and concentration. The results also showed that 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL possessed the highest CO2absorption kinetics among the three concentrations. More importantly, the novel formulated 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL solvent was found to have considerable faster CO2absorption than the conventional 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. triethanolamine (TEA) and 30% wt. TEA solvents, respectively. Based on these observations, it can be summarized that an addition of AMP into MPDL solvent can enhance the overall CO2absorption performance of the formulated AMP-MPDL solvent. Additionally, it can be suggested that the novel formulated AMP-MPDL has a great potential to be used as an alternative solvent for capturing CO2in terms of reaction kinetics; especially, in substitution of conventional AMP-TEA and TEA solvents. © 2020 The Authors",Energy Reports,"{'ISSN': '23524847', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.egyr.2020.08.039', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Absorption', 'Amine', 'CO2capture', 'Kinetics', 'Association reactions', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Drops', 'Kinetics', 'Solvents', 'Tea', 'Triethanolamine', '2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol', 'Absorption kinetics', 'Alternative solvents', 'CO2 absorption', 'Pressure methods', 'Stirred tank reactors', 'Triethanolamines', 'Reaction kinetics']","['aDepartment of Chemical Technology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bCenter of Excellence on Petrochemical and Materials Technology, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, 73170, Thailand', ""dDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, 10140, Thailand"", 'eClean Energy Technologies Research Institute, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Regina, SK, S4S 0A2, Canada']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Higher Education Commission, Pakistan', 'Funding Number': 'MRG6280187', 'Acronym': 'HEC'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Higher Education Commission, Pakistan', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'HEC'}]"

The first part of this paper details mitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms and their importance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, including details of NO networks, the roles of H2O2and the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system, and the relationship between mitochondrial respiration and NADPH production. The second part highlights and identifies the causes of the multiple pathological sequelae arising from self-amplifying increases in mitochondrial ROS production and bioenergetic failure. Particular attention is paid to NAD+depletion as a core cause of pathology; detrimental effects of raised ROS and reactive nitrogen species on ATP and NADPH generation; detrimental effects of oxidative and nitrosative stress on the glutathione and thioredoxin systems; and the NAD+-induced signalling cascade, including the roles of SIRT1, SIRT3, PGC-1α, the FOXO family of transcription factors, Nrf1 and Nrf2.

Prevalence and predictors of glomerular filtration rate decline in patients with diabetic kidney disease using RAAS blocking agents(Article),"['Boonyakrai, C.', 'Chukaew, S.', 'Tuntayothin, W.']","Volume 103, Issue 8, August 2020, Pages 754-761","Background: Diabetes conduces to an increased risk of deteriorating renal impairment. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blocking agents were used to preserve renal progression among type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. However, rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline was still presented. Objective: The present study is to identify the risk factors for rapid eGFR decline among type 2 DM patients using RAAS blocking agents, and to evaluate the impacts of RAAS blocking agents in inappropriate administration to renal events, cerebrovascular events, and coronary events. Materials and Methods: The present study was a retrospective 2-year period study between 2016 and 2017. Patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with RAAS blocking agents. Multivariate logistic regression was used to access the risk factors of the rapid eGFR decline compared with non-rapid eGFR decline. Relative risk was obtained to evaluate the renal outcome between appropriate use of RAAS blocking agents compared with inappropriate usage. Results: Of the total 500 patients, 195 subjects developed rapidly decreased eGFR of more than 5 mL/minute/1.73 m2 over one year. Predictive factors significantly associated with rapid decline eGFR were cardiovascular disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.59; p=0.020), urine albumin creatinine ratio of more than 1000 mg/g (adjusted OR 3.31; p=0.017), and normoalbuminemia (adjusted OR 0.44; p=0.011). There was the significant association with the risk of persistent albuminuria in patients who received inappropriate RAAS blocking agents compared with patients who received appropriate RAAS blocking agents (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.43). Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease, albuminuria, and hypoalbuminemia are the major risk factors leading to rapid decline eGFR developing in type 2 DM patients who received RAAS blocking agents. Moreover, the appropriate use of RAAS blocking agents should be a concerned issue. © JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND.",Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand,"{'ISSN': '01252208', 'Source Type': 'JMTHB', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.35755/jmedassocthai.2020.08.10603', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Albuminuria', 'Diabetic kidney disease', 'RAAS blocking agents', '2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative', 'alogliptin', 'angiotensin receptor antagonist', 'azilsartan', 'dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor', 'dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor', 'enalapril', 'hemoglobin A1c', 'insulin', 'irbesartan', 'linagliptin', 'losartan', 'nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent', 'perindopril', 'pioglitazone', 'ramipril', 'sitagliptin', 'sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor', 'sulfonylurea', 'telmisartan', 'vildagliptin', 'adult', 'aged', 'albumin blood level', 'albuminuria', 'angina pectoris', 'Article', 'body mass', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cerebrovascular disease', 'cholesterol blood level', 'coronary artery anomaly', 'creatinine blood level', 'diabetic nephropathy', 'doubling of serum creatinine level', 'estimated glomerular filtration rate', 'glomerulus filtration rate', 'glucose blood level', 'heart infarction', 'high density lipoprotein cholesterol level', 'human', 'hypoalbuminemia', 'kidney function', 'low density lipoprotein cholesterol level', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'microalbuminuria', 'non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'odds ratio', 'renin angiotensin aldosterone system', 'retrospective study', 'risk factor', 'smoking', 'systolic blood pressure', 'triacylglycerol blood level', 'uric acid blood level']","['aDivision of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taksin Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDiabetes Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Taksin Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cFaculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]

Based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics, the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer (Qfd) and a volcanic aquifer (Vc). Study focus: This research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality. New hydrological insights for the region: The groundwater type in Qfd and Vc is mainly Ca-Na-HCO3, suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources. This study found evidence of ion exchange between Ca2+and Na+in both seasons. The five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76.11 and 77.88 % in the rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Based on correlation analysis and PCA, the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations, including alkali feldspar and Ca2+- and Mg2+- rich minerals. Moreover, some ions arose from anthropogenic activities, typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater.

Meaningful improvement thresholds in measures of pain and quality of life in oral lichen planus(Article)(Open Access),"['Wiriyakijja, P.', 'Porter, S.', 'Fedele, S.', 'Hodgson, T.', 'McMillan, R.', 'Shephard, M.', 'Ni Riordain, R.']","Volume 26, Issue 7, 1 October 2020, Pages 1464-1473","Objectives: To evaluate the responsiveness of measures of pain and oral health-related quality of life (OH-QoL) in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and to determine thresholds for minimal important change (MIC) and minimal important difference (MID) for use in this patient population. Methods: Data from baseline and 4-month follow-up including Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), 15-item and 26-item Chronic Oral Mucosal Disease Questionnaire (COMDQ-15; COMDQ-26) were collected from 157 patients with OLP. Responsiveness was assessed by testing hypotheses and calculating the area under the curve. MIC and MID were established based on triangulation of distribution-based and anchor-based estimates. Results: The results supported adequate responsiveness of VAS, NRS, COMDQ-15 and COMDQ-26 for use in OLP, while the OHIP-14 demonstrated relatively low sensitivity to detect improvement in the OLP status. Recommended meaningful improvement thresholds were as follows: VAS (MIC 16 mm; MID 18 mm), NRS (MIC/MID 2 points), OHIP-14 (MIC/MID 5 points), COMDQ-15 (MIC 5 points; MID 6 points) and COMDQ-26 (MIC/MID 9 points).

Dynamic simulation and control system for chemical looping combustion(Conference Paper)(Open Access),"['Wanotayaroj, T.', 'Chalermsinsuwan, B.', 'Piumsomboon, P.']","Volume 6, February 2020, Pages 32-39","Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a technique for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas. It consists of two main processes: a fuel reactor and an air reactor. In the fuel reactor, fuel reacts with solid metal oxide particles to produce heat, CO2and H2O vapor which later can be easily separated by the condensation. The reacted solid metal is then sent to the air reactor for regenerating via an oxidation reaction with air before being returned to the fuel reactor. In this study, these reactors in the CLC system are integrated as a circulating fluidized bed system and a dynamic model has been developed for the system. The fuel reactor (or downer) operates in bubbling fluidization regime where the air reactor (or riser) operates in fast fluidization regime. Using the developed dynamic model, the transient responses of various control variables such as the temperature of two fluidized bed reactors, pressure and the liquid level of a condenser have been controlled by manipulating variables such as heat transfer rates of the reactors, gas outlet flow rate and liquid outlet flow rate of the condenser. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller was tuned for controlling purpose. The integral of the absolute value of error (IAE) is used to evaluate the control system performance. © 2019",Energy Reports,"{'ISSN': '23524847', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.egyr.2019.11.038', 'Publisher': 'Conference Paper'}","['Aspen Dynamics', 'Chemical looping combustion', 'Dynamic simulation', 'Fluidized bed reactors', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Chemical reactors', 'Computer simulation', 'Dynamic models', 'Fluidization', 'Fluidized bed furnaces', 'Fluidized bed process', 'Fluidized beds', 'Heat transfer', 'Metal fuels', 'Metals', 'Proportional control systems', 'Supersaturation', 'Transient analysis', 'Aspen dynamics', 'Bubbling fluidization', 'Chemical looping combustion', 'Circulating fluidized bed', 'Control system performance', 'Fluidized bed reactors', 'Heat transfer rate', 'Oxidation reactions', 'Fluidized bed combustion']","['aDepartment of Chemical Technology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phyathai Road, Wangmai, Patumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bCenter of Excellence on Petrochemical and Materials Technology, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phyathai Road, Wangmai, Patumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

Gigantol targets MYC for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation and suppresses lung cancer cell growth(Article)(Open Access),"['LOSUWANNARAK, N.', 'ROYTRAKUL, S.', 'CHANVORACHOTE, P.']","Volume 17, Issue 6, December 2020, Pages 781-793","Background: Gigantol is a pharmacologically active bibenzyl compound exerting potential anticancer activities. At non-toxic concentrations, it reduces cancer stem cell properties and tumorigenicity. The mechanisms of the effects of gigantol on cancer cell growth are largely unknown. This study aimed to unravel the molecular profile and identify the prominent molecular mechanism of the effects of gigantol in controlling lung cancer cell proliferation. Materials and Methods: Proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were used accompanied by experimental molecular pharmacology approaches. Results: Gigantol exhibited antiproliferative effects on human lung cancer cells confirmed by 3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay and colony growth assay. The protein profile in response to gigantol treatment associated with regulation of cell proliferation was analyzed to determine the prominent protein targets. Among the significant hub proteins, MYC, an important proto-oncogene and proliferationpromoting transcription factor, was down-regulated with the highest number of protein-protein interactions. MYC downregulation was confirmed by western blot analysis. The upstream regulator of MYC, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) was found to be responsible for MYC destabilization mediated by gigantol. Gigantol facilitated GSK3β function and resulted in the increase of MYC-ubiquitin complex as evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Conclusion: Gigantol was found to inhibit lung cancer proliferation through induction of GSK3β-mediated MYC ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. These data suggest gigantol to be a promising candidate for novel strategy in inhibition of lung cancer. © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

The objective of the study was to understand the distribution of various STEC in raw meat of cattle and goats collected from different meat shops of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Raw meat samples (n=101) were analysed for presence of four virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae and ehxA). The samples positive for one or more virulence genes were subjected to isolation using sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC). Of 101 samples 44 (43.5%) were found positive for one or more virulence genes. The most common combination of virulence genes in samples was stx1, stx2, ehxA (9/44; 20.4%). Nine E. coli isolates positive for one or more virulence genes were recovered from 44 positive samples. The analysis of E. coli isolates for serogroups O157, O26, O103, O111 and O145 using PCR indicated that three E. coli isolates were O111 and one was O26. The serogroup of five E. coli isolates could not be identified. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the E. coli isolates using the disc diffusion method indicated antimicrobial resistance ranging from 33.3 to 100% against eight antibiotics of seven different classes.

Managing diversity through transgender inclusion in developing countries: A collaborative corporate social responsibility initiative from Bangladesh(Article)(Open Access),"['Fontana, E.']","Volume 27, Issue 6, November/December 2020, Pages 2548-2562","While drawing on a collaborative corporate social responsibility initiative to manage diversity, this article investigates the main drivers of discrimination and the ways to reduce discrimination affecting transgenders in organizations in Bangladesh, a developing country. Often part of the “Hijra” community, transgenders in Bangladesh were acknowledged by the government in 2013 as third gender individuals but remain the most excluded of the excluded and struggle to retain jobs. This research finds that Bangladeshi transgenders at work suffer from internal intimidation because of the gurus or leaders in the community and also from direct and indirect workplace harassment from other workers. Subsequently, it offers a typology of collaborative practices to facilitate inclusion based on persuasion and dialog with gurus, the police, imams, and workers. Finally, this article contributes to the nascent literature on diversity management through transgender inclusion as well as the literature on transgenders and the Hijra community in Bangladesh. © 2020 The Author.

The activity of resveratrol plus antimicrobial agents was determined by checkerboard and time-kill assay against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolated from patients at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Overexpression of efflux pumps that mediates chlorhexidine susceptibility was characterized by the ethidium bromide accumulation assay. The effect of resveratrol on the expression of efflux pump genes (adeB, adeJ, adeG abeS, and aceI) and the two-component regulators, adeR and adeS was determined by RT-qPCR. The combination of resveratrol and chlorhexidine resulted in strong synergistic and bactericidal activity against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Up-regulation of adeB and aceI was induced by chlorhexidine. However, the addition of resveratrol increased chlorhexidine susceptibility with increased intracellular accumulation of ethidium bromide in A. baumannii indicating that resveratrol acts as an efflux pump inhibitor. Expression of adeB was significantly reduced in the combination of resveratrol with chlorhexidine indicating that resveratrol inhibits the AdeB efflux pump and restores chlorhexidine effect on A. baumannii. In conclusion, reduced adeB expression in A. baumannii was mediated by resveratrol suggesting that AdeB efflux pump inhibition contributes to the synergistic mechanism of resveratrol with chlorhexidine. Our finding highlights the potential importance of resveratrol in clinical applications. © 2020 Singkham-in et al.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography (TE) is reliable and correlated with liver biopsy. However, TE may not be widely available. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performances of aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) scores compared with TE. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional study, including all chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfection patients with successful and reliable LSM, at 10 centers in Thailand from 2012 to 2017. Characteristics and laboratory data within 3 months of TE were retrospectively reviewed. Using TE as a reference standard, the diagnostic performances of APRI and FIB-4 were evaluated. TE cut-off levels of 7.1 and 12.5 kPa represented significant fibrosis (SF) and cirrhosis, respectively. Results: The distribution of FS by TE in 2000 eligible patients was as follows: no SF 28.3%, SF 31.4%, and cirrhosis 40.3%. APRI ≥ 1 provided 70.1% sensitivity and 80.6% specificity, with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.834 for cirrhosis. The specificity increased to 96.3% when using a cut-off level of APRI ≥ 2. FIB-4 ≥ 1.45 provided a sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC of 52.4%, 91.0%, and 0.829 for cirrhosis, respectively. For SF, APRI performed better than FIB-4, with an AUROC of 0.84 versus 0.80 (P < 0.001). APRI score < 0.5 and FIB-4 score > 1.45 yielded sensitivities of 82.3% and 74.4% and specificities of 65.4% and 69.8%, respectively. Conclusions: APRI and FIB-4 scores had good diagnostic performances for FS assessment compared with TE, especially for cirrhosis.

Mechanochemical reactions of MnO2and graphite nanosheets as a durable zinc ion battery cathode(Article),"['Cao, J.', 'Zhang, D.', 'Zhang, X.', 'Wang, S.', 'Han, J.', 'Zhao, Y.', 'Huang, Y.', 'Qin, J.']","Volume 534, 30 December 2020, Article number 147630","Manganese dioxide has been recognized as the ideal cathode for the aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, the poor conductivity and infinite relative volume changes limit its further practical applications. Herein, we developed a promising cathode design by ball milling of electrolytic manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of graphite nanosheets. MnO2/graphite hybrids with the increase of contact surface and interfacial interaction are beneficial to construct an interfacial 3D conductive network and improve the inherent stability, which achieve the minimum volume change. As expected, the rate and cycling performance of MnO2/graphite hybrids (230 mAh g−1at 0.1 A g−1, 80 mAh g−1at 1 A g−1, 80.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1) are better than that of MnO2(113 mAh g−1at 0.1 A g−1, 24 mAh g−1at 1 A g−1, 51.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1).

Following an early warning in 2017 that TiLV might be widespread, we executed a surveillance programme on tilapia grow-out farms and hatcheries from 10 districts of Bangladesh in 2017 and 2019. Among farms experiencing unusual mortality, eight out of 11 farms tested positive for TiLV in 2017, and two out of seven tested positive in 2019. Investigation of asymptomatic broodstock collected from 16 tilapia hatcheries revealed that six hatcheries tested positive for TiLV. Representative samples subjected to histopathology confirmed pathognomonic lesions of syncytial hepatitis. We recovered three complete genomes of TiLV from infected fish, one from 2017 and two from 2019. Phylogenetic analyses based on both the concatenated coding sequences of 10 segments and only segment 1 consistently revealed that Bangladeshi TiLV isolates formed a unique cluster within Thai clade, suggesting a close genetic relation. In summary, this study revealed the circulation of TiLV in 10 farms and six hatcheries located in eight districts of Bangladesh.

However, the relationship between abnormal sleep BP variations and cerebral small vessel disease markers is poorly established. This study aims to assess the association between non-dipping and reverse-dipping BP patterns with markers of silent cerebral small vessel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Databases were searched from inception through November 2019. Studies that reported the odds ratios (ORs) for cerebral small vessel disease markers in patients with non-dipping or reverse-dipping BP patterns were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using the random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Twelve observational studies composed of 3497 patients were included in this analysis. The reverse-dipping compared with normal dipping BP pattern was associated with a higher prevalence of white matter hyperintensity with a pooled adjusted OR of 2.00 (95% CI, 1.13–2.37; I2=36%). Non-dipping BP pattern compared with normal dipping BP pattern was associated with higher prevalence of white matter hyperintensity and asymptomatic lacunar infarction, with pooled ORs of 1.38 (95% CI, 0.95–2.02; I2=52%) and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.30–4.18; I2=73%), respectively. Limiting to only studies with confounder-adjusted analysis resulted in a pooled OR of 1.38 (95% CI, 0.95–2.02; I2=52%) for white matter hyperintensity and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.97–2.13; I2=0%) for asymptomatic lacunar infarction.

Therefore, we assessed the incidence of AKI and the utilization of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Indonesia. Methods: Demographic and clinical data were collected from 952 ICU participants. The participants were categorized into AKI and non-AKI groups. The participants were further classified according to the 3 different stages of AKI as per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Results: Overall incidence of AKI was 43%. The participants were divided into three groups based on the AKI stages: 18.5% had stage 1, 33% had stage 2, and 48.5% had stage 3. Primary diagnosis of renal disease and high APACHE II score were the risk factors associated with AKI (OR = 4.53, 95% CI: 1.67-12.33, p = 0.003 and OR = 1.14 per 1 unit increase, 95% CI: 1.09-1.20, p < 0.001, respectively). Chronic kidney disease was the risk factor for severe AKI. Sepsis was the leading cause of AKI. Among the AKI participants, 24.6% required RRT. The most common RRT modalities were intermittent hemodialysis (71.7%), followed by slow low-efficiency dialysis (22.8%), continuous renal replacement therapy (4.3%), and peritoneal dialysis (1.1%). Conclusions: This study showed that AKI was a common problem in the Indonesian ICU.

Accrual-based earnings management is measured using the absolute value of performance-matched discretionary accruals. We also use the positive and negative values of performance-matched discretionary accruals to examine income-increasing and income-decreasing earnings management, respectively. Real earnings management proxies are measured using performance-matched measures of the abnormal levels of cash flow from operations, production costs, and discretionary expenses. In summary, our findings indicate no difference in accrual-based earnings management for ADRs reporting under IFRS and U.S. GAAP but suggest that ADRs reporting under IFRS are more likely to manage earnings using income-decreasing discretionary accruals and aggregate real earnings management than ADRs reporting under U.S. GAAP during the financial crisis. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.",Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies,"{'ISSN': '02190915', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1142/S0219091520500150', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['accruals', 'Global financial crisis', 'IFRS', 'real earnings management', 'U.S. GAAP', 'capital flow', 'financial crisis', 'financial market', 'financial provision', 'financial system', 'income distribution', 'United States']","['aChulalongkorn Business School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Business and Information Technology, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Fulton Hall, Rolla, MO  65401, United States']",[]

Three full-scale bridge piers were tested under lateral cyclic loading. A control bridge pier was tested in the as-built condition and the other two bridge piers were experimentally tested after strengthening them with LC-GFRP jacketing. The LC-GFRP strengthening was performed using two different configurations. The control bridge pier showed poor seismic response with the progress of significant cracks at very low drift levels.

Stability analysis of vegetated residual soil slope in Thailand under rainfall conditions(Article),"['Nguyen, T.S.', 'Likitlersuang, S.', 'Jotisankasa, A.']","Volume 7, Issue 5, 1 January 2020, Pages 338-349","The effects of climate change including intense rainfalls have resulted in many slope failures. The bioengineering method using vegetation is an environmentally friendly alternative for slope stabilisation. This paper presents the effect of root reinforcement on the stability of vegetated slope under rainfall condition. A transient seepage and slope stability analysis was conducted based on the finite-element and limit equilibrium methods. Field monitoring on a residual soil slope in Thailand was numerically modelled. In transient seepage analysis, the soil-water characteristic curve and the saturated permeability measured from laboratory and in situ tests were used, and the results were comparable with the monitored values from the site. For slope stability analysis, the effective shear strength parameters from direct shear tests were used to model the well-compacted and non-compacted soil slopes. The additional shear strength of soil from the root cohesion was modelled for vegetated soil slope. The results show that the contribution of root cohesion to slope stability was more significant for the non-compacted soil condition than for the well-compacted one. Both modelled and monitored pore-water pressure reached the highest values about 1-d after the daily rainfall had reached its peak. This finding has a significant implication for landslide warning based on rainfall. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",Environmental Geotechnics,"{'ISSN': '2051803X', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1680/jenge.17.00025', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['landslides', 'permeability', 'seepage', 'Climate change', 'Landslides', 'Rain', 'Shear strength', 'Soil moisture', 'Compacted soil', 'Intense rainfalls', 'Permeability', 'Rainfall condition', 'Residual soil slope', 'Slope stability analysis', 'Soil slopes', 'Stability analyze', 'Thailand', 'Transient seepage', 'Seepage', 'hazard assessment', 'landslide', 'permeability', 'precipitation intensity', 'rainfall', 'residual soil', 'seepage', 'shear strength', 'slope failure', 'slope stability', 'slope stabilization', 'soil mechanics', 'stability analysis', 'vegetation cover', 'warning system', 'Thailand']","['aDepartment of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Mien Trung University of Civil Engineering, Phu Yen, Viet Nam', 'bDepartment of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cGeotechnical Research Unit, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dGeotechnical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '760003-CC', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'RSA-5880023', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'KURDI'}]"

This study examines the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach intervention to improve blood pressure control among elderly persons in rural Thailand. Patients and Methods: This was quasi-experimental study conducted on 200 elderly persons who receive care for hypertension at primary health care facility in rural areas of Thailand. Participants were assigned to either the intervention or control groups. The intervention group was subjected to a multidisciplinary approach intervention program. This program included community-based care for hypertension, family-supportive care for hypertension, antihypertension medication adherence education program, the use of a reminder electronic pill box, and monthly pill counts and blood pressure measurements. The intervention continued for three months. The control group received care for hypertension at the hypertension clinic of the health center. Three measurements were taken at baseline, one month, and three months after the intervention. Data analysis included descrip-tive statistics and independent sample t-tests. Repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the differences between the two groups. Results: At one month and three months after the intervention, the multidisciplinary approach intervention controlled blood pressure more effectively compared with the control group. Furthermore, the intervention group had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with the control group (P-value < 0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest that the multidisciplinary approach intervention can be effective in controlling blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients. Future studies should investigate a cost-effective means of integrating multidisciplinary approach interventions in routine hypertension care for elderly hypertensive patients. © 2020 Woodham et al.",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,"{'ISSN': '11782390', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.2147/JMDH.S254286', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Community base intervention', 'Hypertension', 'Primary health care', 'Universal health coverage', 'aged', 'analysis of covariance', 'analysis of variance', 'article', 'blood pressure measurement', 'blood pressure regulation', 'controlled study', 'data analysis', 'diastolic blood pressure', 'education program', 'female', 'health center', 'health insurance', 'human', 'hypertensive patient', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'pill', 'primary health care', 'quasi experimental study', 'rural area', 'Thailand']","['aCollege of Public Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bSirindhorn College of Public Health Suphanburi, Suphan Buri, Thailand', 'cBuengkan District Health Office, Bueng Kan, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}]"

Behavior of concrete confined with epoxy bonded fiber ropes under axial load(Article),"['Hussain, Q.', 'Ruangrassamee, A.', 'Tangtermsirikul, S.', 'Joyklad, P.']","Volume 263, 10 December 2020, Article number 120093","In the past, several experimental and theoretical studies investigated the axial compressive strength and strain of plain concrete (PC) externally confined with natural and synthetic fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Typical types of synthetic FRP(s) are aramid, glass, carbon, PEN (polyethylene naphthalates) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), whereas natural FRP(s) include flax, sisal, hemp and jute. In this article, the performance of a novel, low-cost and sustainable strengthening technique i.e., fiber rope reinforced polymer (FRRP) composites to enhance the axial compressive strength, strain and deformability of concrete specimens through external wrapping is explored. The outstanding benefits of the newly proposed FRRP composites are low-cost, wide availability, easy application and more environmentally friendly. In this research, 39 circular plain concrete (PC) cylinders were tested to failure under uniaxial compression. The research parameters covered fiber rope type (such as hemp, cotton and polyester) and number of FRRP layers. Experimental results proved that external confinement by using FRRP is very effective to enhance ultimate strength, strain and deformability of the concrete. Further, based on the test results, the implementation of the existing ultimate compressive strength and strain models established for the synthetic and natural FRP(s) is evaluated to assess their application to the newly proposed FRRP confinement. It is found that more or less all considered models do not accurately predict the tested ultimate compressive strength and strain of the FRRP-confined concrete. In the end, new ultimate strength and strain models are proposed to accurately predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of concrete specimens confined with fiber rope reinforced polymer composites. The predicted ultimate compressive strength and strain values compare favorably with the experimental results of the present study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Construction and Building Materials,"{'ISSN': '09500618', 'Source Type': 'CBUME', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120093', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Compressive strength', 'Concrete', 'Confinement', 'Confinement model', 'Cotton', 'Deformability', 'Fiber Reinforced Polymers', 'FRRP', 'Hemp', 'Polyester, Rope', 'Aliphatic compounds', 'Circular cylinders', 'Compressive strength', 'Concrete testing', 'Costs', 'Deformation', 'Fiber reinforced plastics', 'Fibers', 'Formability', 'Hemp', 'Plastic bottles', 'Polyethylenes', 'Reinforcement', 'Rope', 'Axial compressive strength', 'External confinement', 'Fiber reinforced polymer composites', 'Reinforced polymer composites', 'Reinforced polymers', 'Strengthening technique', 'Ultimate compressive strength', 'Uni-axial compression', 'Fiber reinforced concrete']","['aCenter of Excellence in Earthquake Engineering and Vibration, Department of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand', 'bSchool of Civil Engineering, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Srinakharinwirot University, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'MRG6180096', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Asian Institute of Technology', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'AIT'}]"

Therefore, only little analytical information on objective and constraint functions is available. This paper presents an adaptive algorithm called the Surrogate-Based Constrained Global-Optimization (SCGO) method to solve black-box constrained simulation-based optimization problems involving computationally expensive objective function and inequality constraints. Firstly, Kriging surrogate is constructed over a new overall objective function (called loss function) to approximate the behavior of a true model. Then, an adaptive approach is provided to improve the optimal results sequentially while enforcing a feasible solution. The SCGO method is tested on several classical engineering design problems namely design of a tension/compression spring, design of a welded beam, design of a pressure vessel, and three-bar truss design. The results demonstrate that SCGO has advantages in solving the costly constrained problems and needs less costly function evaluations. Optimization results prove that the proposed algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. © 2020 The Authors.

These shifted Chebyshev polynomials are symmetric (either with respect to the point x = L/2 or the vertical line x = L/2 depending on their degree) over [0, L], and their zeros in the interval are distributed symmetrically. We use these zeros to construct the main tool of FIM-SCP: the Chebyshev integration matrix. The forward difference quotient is used to deal with the temporal variable. Then, we obtain efficient numerical algorithms for solving both the direct and inverse problems. However, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem causes instability in the solution and, so, the Tikhonov regularization method is utilized to stabilize the solution.

Nonetheless, MnO2cathodes are subjected to challenging issues viz. limited capacity, low rate capability and poor cycling stability. It is seen that the MnO2heterostructure can enable long-term cycling stability in different types of energy devices. Herein, a versatile chemical method for the preparation of MnO2heterostructure on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MNH-CNT) is reported. Besides, the synthesized MNH-CNT is composed of δ- MnO2and γ-MnO2. A ZIB using the MNH-CNT cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 236 mAh g−1at 400 mA g−1, 108 mAh g−1at 1600 mA g−1and excellent cycling stability.

At 12-month follow-up, 30 (51%) were prescribed antireflux medications and 25 (42%) had persistent GERD symptoms. The median (IQR) hospitalization rate was 2.5 (2 to 3) times/year. Only 1 (1.7%) patient, who had esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula, underwent reoperation due to fundoplication disruption. There were 9 deaths (15.3%). Causes of death were GERD-related aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), sepsis (n = 5), hospital-acquired pneumonia (n = 2), and recurrent ependymoma (n = 1). Conclusion: Most patients with GERD who have comorbid conditions have persistent symptoms and need continuing antireflux medications after fundoplication. Therefore, long-term follow-up of GERD patients following fundoplication is essential, particularly those at risk of a high failure rate of fundoplication. © JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND| 2020",Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand,"{'ISSN': '01252208', 'Source Type': 'JMTHB', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.35755/jmedassocthai.2020.S08.12007', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Children', 'Fundoplication', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'GERD', 'Outcome', 'Article', 'aspiration pneumonia', 'child', 'comorbidity', 'ependymoma', 'esophagogastroduodenoscopy', 'esophagus atresia', 'esophagus perforation', 'female', 'gastroesophageal reflux', 'hospital acquired pneumonia', 'hospitalization', 'human', 'ICD-9', 'length of stay', 'lifestyle modification', 'long term care', 'lung disease', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'mortality rate', 'neurologic disease', 'Nissen fundoplication', 'pH', 'postoperative complication', 'prevalence', 'respiratory tract disease', 'retrospective study', 'stomach fundoplication', 'Thal fundoplication', 'tracheoesophageal fistula', 'urinary tract infection', 'wound infection']","['aDepartment of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]
"Spatial distribution of pm10and PM2.5in Ambient Air at E-waste Dismantling Community in Buriram, Thailand(Conference Paper)","['Chanthahong, S.', 'Prueksasit, T.', 'Sahanavin, N.', 'Kanjanasiranont, N.']","2020, Pages 371-379","The spatial distribution of PM10and PM2.5was observed at the e-waste dismantling community in Daengyai and Banpao subdistrict, Buriram, Thailand. High and low volume air samplers were used to collect PM10and PM2.5in the ambient air, respectively, at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, open dumpsite, and reference area. The sampling was performed during summer and rainy seasons of 2019 for 24 h and seven consecutive days. The average concentrations of PM10were 49.64 ± 17.71, 55.36 ± 17.46 and 57.61 ± 17.55 µg/m3at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, and open dump area, respectively. For PM2.5, the average concentrations at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, and open dump area were 29.71 ± 14.28, 33.81 ± 18.85, 30.68 ± 13.53 µg/m3, respectively. PM10levels at open dumpsite were 1.2 and 1.1 times higher than those of e-waste dismantling area and non-e-waste dismantling area. Meanwhile, ANOVA analysis showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) of PM10concentration between non- and e-waste dismantling, and open dumpsite. The level of PM2.5at the e-waste dismantling area was only higher than the reference area but lower than non-e-waste dismantling and open dump area. Besides, there was no statistically significant difference between all sampling sites for PM2.5concentration. PM10at non-e-waste dismantling area and open dumpsite were exceeded guidelines of WHO (50 µg/m3), and also PM2.5(25 µg/m3) of all sampling areas. In this e-waste community, there is no zoning provided for e-waste dismantling activities. Consequently, e-waste dismantling houses were randomly distributed in the community. Consequently, it can be indicated that e-waste dismantling activities led to more PM10contribution than PM2.5. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Environmental Science and Engineering,"{'ISSN': '18635520', 'Source Type': '978-303045262-9', 'Original Language': 'Book Series'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/978-3-030-45263-6_33', 'Publisher': 'Conference Paper'}","['Ambient air pollution', 'E-waste', 'PM10', 'PM2.5', 'Spatial distribution', 'Planning', 'Spatial distribution', 'Sustainable development', 'Wastes', 'ANOVA analysis', 'Average concentration', 'PM10 and PM2.5', 'PM10 concentration', 'PM2.5 concentration', 'Randomly distributed', 'Sampling areas', 'Statistically significant difference', 'Electronic Waste']","['aInterdisciplinary Program in Environmental Science, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Wang Mai, Pathumwan District, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Environmental Science, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'cCenter of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Public Health, Faculty of Physical Education, Srinakharinwirot University, Nakhonnayok, 26120, Thailand', 'eFaculty of Environment and Resource Studies, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom  73170, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Office of the Higher Education Commission', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'OHEC'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Science and Technology Postgraduate Education and Research Development Office, Office of the Higher Education Commission', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'PERDO'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Research Council of Thailand', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NRCT'}]"

Effect of mixing method on properties of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer/natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates(Article)(Open Access),"['Kunanusont, N.', 'Samthong, C.', 'Bowen, F.', 'Yamaguchi, M.', 'Somwangthanaroj, A.']","Volume 12, Issue 8, August 2020, Article number 1739","Thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) has excellent elastomeric properties and can be reprocessed multiple times. TPV is typically produced by using the dynamic vulcanization (DV) method in which rubber is crosslinked simultaneously with thermoplastics. Peroxide-crosslinked TPV can increase the compatibility between rubber and thermoplastics but loses its reprocessability due to excess crosslinking in the latter. In this work, we overcome this obstacle by using a two-step mixing method to prepare fully crosslinked elastomers of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and natural rubber (NR). Each sample formulation was prepared with three different mixing methods for comparison: NR-DV, Split-DV, and All-DV. For NR-DV, NR was crosslinked prior to the addition of EVA together with the thermal stabilizer (TS). For Split-DV, a small amount of EVA and NR was crosslinked prior to the addition of EVA and TS. In the All-DV method, EVA and NR were crosslinked, and then TS was added. The appearance and processability of the samples were affected by the degree of crosslinking. NR-DV showed a non-homogeneous texture. Although the samples of the All-DV method appeared homogeneous, their mechanical and rheological properties were inferior to those of the Split-DV method. The mechanical properties of the Split-DV samples were not significantly changed after reprocessing 10 times. Therefore, Split-DV is the preferred method for TPV production. © 2020 by the authors.",Polymers,"{'ISSN': '20734360', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.3390/POLYM12081739', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Capillary rheometer', 'Dynamic vulcanization', 'Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer', 'Mixing method', 'Natural rubber', 'Thermoplastic vulcanizate', 'Aliphatic compounds', 'Capillary flow', 'Ethylene', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Mixing', 'Polyvinyl acetates', 'Reinforced plastics', 'Textures', 'Thermoplastic elastomers', 'Cross-linked elastomers', 'Degree of cross-linking', 'Dynamic vulcanization', 'Elastomeric properties', 'Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer', 'Rheological property', 'Thermal stabilizers', 'Thermoplastic vulcanizates', 'Rubber']","['aDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bSchool of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa, 923-1292, Japan']","[{'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': 'PHD58I0027', 'Acronym': ''}]"

A Potential Biomarker from Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Parametric Response Map Analysis for Treatment Response Prediction in Nasopharyngeal Cancer(Conference Paper)(Open Access),"['Jirawatwanith, T.', 'Tangyoosuk, T.', 'Lertbutsayanukul, C.', 'Jittapiromsak, N.', 'Rakvongthai, Y.']","Volume 1505, Issue 1, 15 June 2020, Article number 012032","Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an MRI technique which provides functional information of tissue by detecting microscopic motion of water molecules. The change of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DWI was used as an imaging biomarker for treatment response prediction in cancers [1]. However, it was based on whole-tumor analysis which did not reflect heterogeneity within the tumor. To overcome this limitation, a new method called parametric response map (PRM) analysis was proposed to evaluate response by quantifying voxel-wise changes in ADC [2]. Here we investigated the use of PRM analysis on ADC from DWI as an imaging biomarker for treatment response prediction in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. We collected thirteen patient datasets including ten complete response (CR) patients and three partial response (PR) patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital where one patient dataset consisted of DWI and ADC data acquired before (i.e. pre-treatment) and at five weeks after (i.e. mid-treatment) initiation of chemoradiation therapy. For each dataset, we compared pre-treatment ADC image with co-registered mid-treatment ADC image, and calculated the percentage of voxels with increased ADC values with respect to total voxels within the tumor ROI, defined as PRM+. To validate the feasibility of the PRM biomarker, we computed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of percentage change in tumor volume (%AVol ) and in ADC (%AADC) and PRM+ across CR and PR patients, where tumor response was from 6-month follow-up data using RECIST1.1 guideline. The results showed that %AVol as well as %AADC between both groups was not significantly different. In contrast, PRM+ was significantly different between both groups (p < 0.05, 82.7±7.8% in CR vs 66.7±6.5% in PR). Our results implied that the proposed PRM+ biomarker could be a potential biomarker for early treatment response prediction in NPC patients. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"{'ISSN': '17426588', 'Source Type': 'Conference Proceeding', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1088/1742-6596/1505/1/012032', 'Publisher': 'Conference Paper'}","['Biomarkers', 'Biophysics', 'Diseases', 'Forecasting', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Medical Physics', 'Molecules', 'Surface diffusion', 'Tumors', 'Apparent diffusion coefficient', 'Chemoradiation therapies', 'Diffusion weighted imaging', 'Functional information', 'Imaging biomarkers', 'Mean and standard deviations', 'Nasopharyngeal cancer', 'Treatment response', 'Patient treatment']","['aMedical Physics Program, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDivision of Diagnostic Radiology, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cDivision of Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dDivision of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'eChulalongkorn University Biomedical Imaging Group, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']",[]

The K2CO3solid sorbent in circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFB) is nominated as an efficient method for capturing CO2in flue gas. The CFB reactor consists of two reactors including circulating fluidized bed riser (CFBR) and circulating fluidized bed downer (CFBD). The study focused on the CFBR as it was used in adsorption process. However, CO2capture capacity is limited due to the equilibrium at the specific system temperature. This study developed the computational fluid dynamics model of the nonisothermal circulating fluidized bed riser which included effect of the cooling water tube.

Depression can manifest itself as fatigue, and depressive symptoms are often mistaken for fatigue, and vice versa. The two conditions are sometimes difficult to differentiate, and their relationship is unclear. Whether chronic fatigue and depression occur primarily, secondarily or coincidentally with activated immune-inflammatory pathways in MS is still under debate. We have carried out a descriptive review aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between chronic fatigue and depression in MS, and the shared pathways that underpin both conditions. This review focuses on immune-inflammatory pathways, the kynurenine pathway and the gut-brain axis. It seems likely that proinflammatory cytokines, tryptophan catabolites (the KYN pathway) and the gut-brain axis are involved in the mechanisms causing chronic fatigue and MDD-like symptoms in MS. However, the evidence base is weak, and more research is needed. In order to advance our understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms, MS-related fatigue and depression should be examined using a longitudinal design and both immune-inflammatory and KYN pathway biomarkers should be measured, relevant clinical characteristics judiciously registered, and self-report instruments for both fatigue and depression should be used. © 2020",Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders,"{'ISSN': '22110348', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.msard.2020.102533', 'Publisher': '33010585'}","['cytokine', 'kynurenine', 'tryptophan', 'tryptophan', 'amino acid metabolism', 'autoimmunity', 'behavior disorder', 'brain', 'chronic disease', 'clinical feature', 'disease activity', 'disease association', 'disease course', 'disease marker', 'fatigue', 'gut brain axis', 'human', 'immune response', 'immunopathogenesis', 'immunopathology', 'intestine', 'major depression', 'metabolite', 'mood disorder', 'multiple sclerosis', 'nervous system inflammation', 'nonhuman', 'pathophysiology', 'protein function', 'Review', 'self report', 'sleep disorder', 'study design', 'symptom', 'brain', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'complication', 'depression', 'multiple sclerosis', 'quality of life', 'Brain', 'Depression', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Tryptophan']","['aUniversity of South-Eastern Norway and University Oslo Metropolitan University', 'bVestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway', 'cChulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'dMedical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'eIMPACT Strategic Center, Deakin University, Australia', 'fCRC Scotland & London, Eccleston Square, London, United Kingdom', 'gOslo University Hospital and University of Oslo']",[]

Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 and June 2019, 171 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent minimally invasive radical prostatectomy. These were LRP in 62 patients and RALP in 109 patients. All clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic data, perioperative parameters, pathological reports, oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes including continence and potency rate at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared between groups. Results: Patients in the RALP group were significantly younger (p=0.03) and had a shorter follow-up period (p=0.004). The estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the RALP group (p=0.001). There were no significant differences in intraoperative and 30-day postoperative complications. Pathological results and overall positive surgical margin rate (PSM) were not significantly different. In pT3 patients, PSM was significantly lower in the RALP group (p=0.045). Oncological outcomes were not different in term of biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate (p=0.3), median time to BCR (p=0.45), BCR-free survival (p=0.81), and overall survival (p=0.99). The continence rate was significantly better in the RALP group in every period after surgery (p=0.01, <0.001, 0.001, and p=0.02 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively). The potency rate who performed bilateral neurovascular bundles sparing was not different between groups. Conclusion: RALP provided a significant improvement of continence recovery and PSM rate in non-organ confined disease. Estimated blood loss was significantly lower among the RALP patient.

The apoptotic and free radical–scavenging abilities of the protein hydrolysate obtained from chicken feather meal(Article)(Open Access),"['Jeampakdee, P.', 'Puthong, S.', 'Srimongkol, P.', 'Sangtanoo, P.', 'Saisavoey, T.', 'Karnchanatat, A.']","Volume 99, Issue 3, March 2020, Pages 1693-1704","This study examined the antioxidant capabilities of peptides derived from chicken feather meal (CFM) protein hydrolysates which were produced using 3 different microbial proteases (Neutrase, Alcalase, and flavourzyme) and tested at varying concentrations, namely 1, 2, and 5% by weight. The highest levels of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activities were presented by CFM hydrolysate derived using 5 wt% Neutrase and digested for 4 h. Fractionation of this particular hydrolysate was then performed by applying 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes. It was then determined that the molecular weight (MW) < 0.65 kDa fraction achieved the greatest level of free radical scavenging activity in the context of DPPH and ABTS. The MW < 0.65 kDa fraction then underwent additional fractionation using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to derive 3 main fractions designated as F1, F2, and F3. All of these fractions presented a high level of activity in DPPH radical scavenging, although no significant ABTS scavenging was observed. Quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry was used in determining the peptide contents of the fractions as Phe-Asp-Asp-Arg-Gly-Arg-X for F1(FDDRGRX, 875 Da), Val-Thr-Leu-Ala-Val-Thr-Lys-His for F2(VTLAVTKH, 868 Da), and Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-X-Ser-Ile-Pro-Ile-Ser for F3(VSEIXSIPIS, 1,055 Da). Moreover, the F2fraction was shown to be capable of preventing DNA damage induced by hydroxyl radicals, as indicated in tests using the plasmids pKS, pUC19, and pBR322 via the Fenton reaction.

The optimal method for building damage fragility curve development(Article)(Open Access),"['Janpila, A.', 'Foytong, P.', 'Tirapat, S.', 'Thanasisathit, N.', 'Ruangrassamee, A.']","Volume 18, Issue 69, 2020, Pages 74-80","A fragility curve is a primary component in the risk assessment, which is useful for evacuation planning, estimation of potential losses, and estimation of the damage to residential buildings caused by natural hazards. In general, a fragility curve represents the relationship between the probability of exceeding a specific damage state of a structure and natural hazard intensity. For determining such a curve, two parameters: the median and standard deviation are estimated. A fragility curve can be constructed using empirical data and analytical data. Numerical fitting data is used to develop the fragility curve. Various methods have been proposed using numerical fitting data to approximate the fragility curves. However, the most widely used methods for developing fragility curves are the least-squares method and the maximum likelihood method. In this present study, these two different numerical fitting data methods for fragility curve development are analyzed and compared. Basic assumptions and limitations of each method are also discussed. The building damage data used in all methods to derive the fragility curve is generated from hypothetical damage data assuming a lognormal distribution. Finally, the maximum likelihood method is proven to be optimal for developing fragility curve based on structural damage data. Copyright © Int. J. of GEOMATE.

R&D investment that enhances IT firm survival(Conference Paper),"['Patrakosol, B.']","Volume 2020-December, 2020, Pages 483-488","IT industry is a research-intensive industry. IT firms focus on advanced research activities to stay relevant. Their survival depends on value creations from innovations based on the research. Source of fund to these innovation-related activities are commonly expressed in terms of R&D investment. However, this investment is not the direct indicator of innovation outcome, which impacts firm's survival. This is the gap between R&D investment and survivability of the firm. To narrow the gap, innovation process and value creation have been focuses of firm's innovation literature. The literature has narrowed the gap, but uncertainty still largely exists. Both researchers and practitioners often classified R&D investment as a risky investment. This study continues this line of conversation and offers empirical evidence suggesting that R&D investment could be risk mitigator rather than risk enhancer. Data of 2,087 firm-years in IT industry revealed that successful IT firms may invest in R&D to mitigate innovation-related competitive risks. When risk is under control, survivability of the firm increases. IT firm should, therefore, prioritize R&D investment for innovations and products that mitigate competitive risks. This insight is particularly relevant to post CoVID-19 pandemic world because the survival of IT firms depends on how they perceive risks associated with the new-normal world and how they innovate to mitigate those risks. © 2020 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

Reuse of Immobilized Weissella cibaria PN3 for Long-Term Production of Both Extracellular and Cell-Bound Glycolipid Biosurfactants(Article)(Open Access),"['Subsanguan, T.', 'Khondee, N.', 'Nawavimarn, P.', 'Rongsayamanont, W.', 'Chen, C.-Y.', 'Luepromchai, E.']","Volume 8, 3 July 2020, Article number 751","Lactic acid bacteria (LABs) are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and therefore, LAB biosurfactants are beneficial with negligible negative impacts. This study aims to maintain the biosurfactant producing activity of an LAB strain, Weissella cibaria PN3, by immobilizing the bacterial cells on a commercial porous carrier. For biosurfactant production, 2% soybean oil was used as the carbon source. After 72 h, immobilized cells were reused by replacing production medium. The extracellular and cell-bound biosurfactants were extracted from the resulting cell-free broth and cell pellets, respectively. SEM images of used immobilizing carriers showed increased surface roughness and clogged pores over time. Thus, the immobilizing carriers were washed in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) before reuse. To maintain biosurfactant production activity, immobilized cells were reactivated every three production cycles by incubating the washed immobilizing carriers in LB medium for 48 h. The maximum yields of purified extracellular (1.46 g/L) and cell-bound biosurfactants (1.99 g/L) were achieved in the 4th production cycle. The repeated biosurfactant production of nine cycles were completed within 1 month, while only 2 g of immobilized cells/L were applied. The extracellular and cell-bound biosurfactants had comparable surface tensions (31 – 33 mN/m); however, their CMC values were different (1.6 and 3.2 g/L, respectively). Both biosurfactants had moderate oil displacement efficiency with crude oil samples but formed emulsions well with gasoline, diesel, and lavender, lemongrass and coconut oils. The results suggested that the biosurfactants were relatively hydrophilic. In addition, the mixing of both biosurfactants showed a synergistic effect, as seen from the increased emulsifying activity with palm, soybean and crude oils. The biosurfactants at 10 – 16 mg/mL showed antimicrobial activity toward some bacteria and yeast but not filamentous fungi. The molecular structures of these biosurfactants were characterized by FTIR as different glycolipid congeners. The biosurfactant production process by immobilized Weissella cibaria PN3 cells was relatively cheap given that two types of biosurfactants were simultaneously produced and no new inoculum was required. The acquired glycolipid biosurfactants have high potential to be used separately or as mixed biosurfactants in various products, such as cleaning agents, food-grade emulsifiers and cosmetic products. © Copyright © 2020 Subsanguan, Khondee, Nawavimarn, Rongsayamanont, Chen and Luepromchai.",Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"{'ISSN': '22964185', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.3389/fbioe.2020.00751', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['biosurfactant characterization', 'biosurfactant production', 'glycolipids', 'immobilization', 'lactic acid bacteria', 'Bacteria', 'Biomolecules', 'Cell culture', 'Cells', 'Crude oil', 'Emulsification', 'Lactic acid', 'Palm oil', 'Soybean oil', 'Surface roughness', 'Anti-microbial activity', 'Biosurfactant production', 'Emulsifying activity', 'Glycolipid biosurfactants', 'Lactic acid bacteria', 'Long term production', 'Oil-displacement efficiency', 'Synergistic effect', 'Surface active agents']","['aInternational Program in Hazardous Substance and Environmental Management, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bResearch Program on Remediation Technologies for Petroleum Contamination, Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cDepartment of Natural Resources and Environment, Faculty of Agriculture Natural Resources and Environment, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand', 'dMicrobial Technology for Marine Pollution Treatment Research Unit, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'eFaculty of Environment and Resource Studies, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand', 'fDepartment of Earth and Environmental Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Thailand Research Fund', 'Funding Number': 'RSA6280040', 'Acronym': 'TRF'}]"

Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) is chosen as thermoelectric material because it is conveniently used in low quality waste heat. This paper aims to devise and set up a high efficiency heat exchanger for gas to gas application which mimics general waste heat with an additional function of partially converting thermal energy into electrical energy. This heat exchanger has a potential to reduce heat loss in the form of flue gas typically released to the environment. Some of the thermal energy that transfers through this unit is directly converted into electrical energy by using integrated thermoelectric generators (TEGs). An equipment in the form of countercurrent heat exchanger equipped with integrated TEGs is installed and tested. The results show temperature dependent thermoelectric properties from an open circuit experiment. They show power output in several cases of TEG connection patterns from a closed circuit experiment. The best power output of this system is 1,752 mW. The most thermoelectric efficiency is 0.16%. The best value of the maximum thermoelectric efficiency is 0.65%.

This study aimed to investigate relationships of serum adiponectin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), interleukin (IL)-6, and physical performance in knee OA patients. A total of 175 knee OA patients and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Serum adiponectin, 25(OH)D, IL-6, biochemical markers, knee pain and functional scores, muscle strength, physical performance, metabolic parameters, and body composition were evaluated. Serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in knee OA patients than that in controls, while its serum levels were significantly decreased in obese patients, especially those with sarcopenia. Furthermore, there were independent relationships of serum adiponectin with body composition parameters, knee pain scores, physical function tests, and metabolic parameters in knee OA patients. Besides, serum adiponectin levels were positively associated with 25(OH)D levels, and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels in knee OA. Additionally, low serum adiponectin could be used to distinguish knee OA patients with sarcopenic obesity from those without sarcopenic obesity. Circulating adiponectin levels may serve as a possible surrogate biomarker for exacerbated physical function in knee OA patients—particularly sarcopenic obesity. © 2020, L.

Efficacy and Safety of Oral Minoxidil 5 mg Once Daily in the Treatment of Male Patients with Androgenetic Alopecia: An Open-Label and Global Photographic Assessment(Article)(Open Access),"['Panchaprateep, R.', 'Lueangarun, S.']","Volume 10, Issue 6, December 2020, Pages 1345-1357","Introduction: Oral minoxidil is an antihypertensive vasodilator known to stimulate hair growth. The use of low-dose oral minoxidil for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is receiving increasing attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral minoxidil for the treatment of male AGA. Methods: This was an open-label, prospective, single-arm study. Thirty men aged 24–59 years with AGA types III vertex to V were treated with oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily for 24 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by hair counts, hair diameter measurements, photographic assessment, and self-administered questionnaire. The safety of the treatment was closely monitored by means of physical examinations and laboratory investigations. Results: There was a significant increase in total hair counts from baseline at weeks 12 (mean change + 26, range 182.5–208.5 hairs/cm2) and 24 (mean change + 35.1, range 182.5–217.6 hairs/cm2) (both p = 0.007). Photographic assessment of the vertex area by an expert panel revealed 100% improvement (score > + 1), with 43% of patients showing excellent improvement (score + 3, 71–100% increase). The frontal area also showed a significant response but less than that of the vertex area. Common side effects were hypertrichosis (93% of patients) and pedal edema (10%). No serious cardiovascular adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. Conclusion: Oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily effectively increased hair growth in our male patients with AGA and had a good safety profile in healthy subjects. However, oral minoxidil should be used carefully with men who have severe hypertension and increased risk for cardiovascular events. © 2020, The Author(s).",Dermatology and Therapy,"{'ISSN': '21938210', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1007/s13555-020-00448-x', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Androgenetic alopecia', 'Asian', 'Male pattern hair loss', 'Oral minoxidil', 'Side effects', 'Treatment', 'alanine aminotransferase', 'aspartate aminotransferase', 'calcium channel blocking agent', 'minoxidil', 'adult', 'aging', 'alanine aminotransferase blood level', 'Article', 'aspartate aminotransferase blood level', 'clinical article', 'clinical trial', 'cohort analysis', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disease duration', 'drug efficacy', 'drug safety', 'electrocardiogram', 'evening dosage', 'follow up', 'foot edema', 'hair analysis', 'hair growth', 'hair loss', 'heart size', 'heart ventricle extrasystole', 'human', 'hypertension', 'hypertensive patient', 'hypertrichosis', 'low drug dose', 'male', 'male type alopecia', 'medical photography', 'morning dosage', 'obese patient', 'open study', 'orthostatic hypotension', 'patient satisfaction', 'physical examination', 'priority journal', 'prospective study', 'sodium restriction', 'T wave inversion', 'treatment outcome', 'vellus hair']","['aDepartment of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'bDivision of Dermatology, Chulabhorn International College of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '496/55', 'Acronym': 'MDCU'}]"

Nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 revealed G3P[8] as the predominant strain (33.2%,75/226), followed by G9P[8] (17.3%,39/226), and G2P[4] (15.0%,34/ 226). Uncommon G and P combinations were additionally detected at low frequencies. VP6 sequencing was conducted to discriminate I genotype between the Wa and DS-1 genogroup. The unusual DS-1-like G3P[8] strain was most prevalent amomg rotavirus strains detected in this study (29.6%, 67/226), and the corresponding VP7 sequences showed high nucleotide identity with unusual DS-1-like globally circulating strains. Our study demonstrates that rotavirus outbreaks in adults are attributable not only to high prevalence of RV infection but also the unusual DS-like genogroup. The collective findings reinforce the importance of investigating rotavirus diagnosis in adults suffering from acute gastroenteritis and taking appropriate preventive measures. © 2020 Chansaenroj et al.

Great challenge in the form of global environmental problem has been faced by human society. Policy agendas for each country are governed by the political institutions. The present study aims to investigate the association among the state of political institution, environmental emission, and development indicator while taking the impact of economic conditions such as free economy, fluctuating economy, deteriorated economy and improvised economy under consideration. The study has collected the data of 10 ASEAN countries over the period from 1979 to 2014. The panel data methodology is employed to answer the question raised in study. The fixed effect estimates indicate that, economic growth is in significant positive relationship with change in democratic situation emission. It is also evident that the CO2emission is higher in fluctuating ASEAN economies with relatively weak democracy such as Indonesia and Thailand and negative in the improvised democracies such Singapore. The study is among the pioneering studies on the current issue. This study will provide a guideline in environmental policy implementation. © 2020, Econjournals.

Biodiesel-derived glycerol is expected to be applied in bioindustries. However, major limitation of industrial fermentation is that the rate of substrate consumption is significantly slower than conventional process. In this study, in order to improve the consumption of refined crude glycerol in Klebsiella aerogenes, casein hydrolysate was supplemented in main medium. As a result, the substrate consumption rate, cell and ethanol concentration were improved about 2.6-fold, 2.5-fold and 3.0-fold, respectively, compared with the control group. In addition, four components of the main medium (peptone, ammonium sulfate, casein hydrolysate, refined crude glycerol) were statistically optimized. The consumption of glycerol was achieved about 89%, and the productivity of bioethanol was found to be 0.83 g/(L h) under the optimized medium. Also, the bioethanol concentration and yield were 15.89 g/L and 0.487 (g/g), respectively. The supplementation of casein hydrolysate had a significant effect on fermentation. It was proved by analyzing the concentration of free amino acids contained in casein hydrolysate. As a result, it was found that glycerol consumption and bioethanol production were promoted by the abundant supply of essential amino acids contained in casein hydrolysate for cell growth. Therefore, these results will be the basis for sustainable development by providing the opportunity to reuse crude glycerol for industrial applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Energy Conversion and Management,"{'ISSN': '01968904', 'Source Type': 'ECMAD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113181', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Bioethanol', 'Biorefinery', 'Casein hydrolysate', 'Glycerol', 'Klebsiella aerogenes', 'Amino acids', 'Bacteria', 'Biodiesel', 'Bioethanol', 'Casein', 'Cell proliferation', 'Ethanol', 'Fermentation', 'Glycerol', 'Nitrogen compounds', 'Sulfur compounds', 'Bio-ethanol production', 'Biodiesel-derived glycerols', 'Casein hydrolysate', 'Essential amino acids', 'Ethanol concentrations', 'Industrial fermentation', 'ITS applications', 'Substrate consumption rate', 'Dairies']","['aDepartment of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, 145, Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, South Korea', 'bDepartment of Biotechnology, Sangmyung University, 20, Hongjimun 2-Gil, Jongno-Gu, Seoul, 03016, South Korea', 'cDepartment of Interdisciplinary Bio-Micro System Technology, College of Engineering, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, South Korea', 'dPlant Biomass Utilization Research Unit, Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Korea University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'KU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Research Foundation of Korea', 'Funding Number': '2020R1C1C1005060,NRF-2019R1A2C1006793', 'Acronym': 'NRF'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'National Research Foundation of Korea', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'NRF'}]"

Effects of the PNiPAM loading level in the range of 0–40% by weight (wt%) on the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the CMC/PNiPAMx films (where x is the wt% of PNiPAM) were symmetrically investigated. The obtained CMC/PNiPAMx films showed a high compatibility between the polymers. The CMC/PNiPAM20 blend showed the greatest tensile strength and modulus at 37.9 MPa and 2.1 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the thermal degradation of CMC was retarded by the addition of PNiPAM. Scanning electron microscopy images of CMC/PNiPAM20 revealed a porous structure that likely supported Zn2+movement in the SPEs containing zinc triflate, resulting in the high Zn2+ion transference number (0.56) and ionic conductivity (1.68 × 10–4S cm−1). Interestingly, the presence of PNiPAM in the CMC/PNiPAMx blends showed a greater stability during charge–discharge cyclic tests, indicating the ability of PNiPAM to suppress dendrite formation from causing a short circuit.

The design addressed in this paper is concerned with robust state estimator of stochastic genetic networks in the presence of nonlinear uncertainties. The objective is to estimate the true concentrations of mRNAs and proteins of the noisy nonlinear genetic networks. Based on the notion of Lyapunov functions, we improve the design condition for the robust estimator to ensure that the estimation error satisfies H∞performance criterion. The sufficient condition is derived in terms of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities, which are convex constraints, and can be efficiently solved via the sum-of-squares technique.

The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical, hematological and biochemical profile of H. canis-positive dogs and the relationship of the number of H. canis gamonts, animal signalment, and hematological and biochemical values. A total of 185 H. canis-positive blood samples were examined, including buffy coat smears and comprehensive data. The number of gamonts was randomly counted from buffy coat smears samples (75/185). The dogs infected with H. canis presented to the animal hospital mostly for health status checks, anorexia, or accidents. Observations from the physical examination on the first day of registration included systemic abnormalities such as digestive, integument, respiratory, urogenital, etc. Most of the dogs showed clinical signs of systemic abnormality in more than one system.

Accordingly, this work was to find the optimal business models of centralization and decentralization biogas plants by considering the suitable biogas plant location and transportation in Ratchaburi province, Thailand. Geographical Information System (GIS) and economic assessment of two operation models were considered. The central feature function with simple additive weight was used to analyse the suitable biogas plant location while the suitable transportation route for collecting feedstock was analysed by the function of network analysis. The analytical results showed that the optimal location of the 0.1 MW biogas power plant was located at Mueang Ratchaburi district where the highway was connected with the location of the power plant making convenient for transportation. The shortest travel distance in one trip per day from selected small-scale swine farms was 96 km. In addition, the economic assessment of operational models between centralization and decentralization was compared by considering financial indicators including net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), benefit-cost ratio (B/C), and payback period (PB). The costs of biogas plants comprising transportation cost of feedstock, investment, operating and maintenance costs, and benefits of biogas plants were considered.

Although green roof ecosystems (GREs) are able to provide ecosystem services, there is currently no assessment tool available to specifically evaluate this. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a rapid assessment checklist (RAC) to assess GRE services (GRES), which was developed and tested on 10 green roofs in Bangkok, Thailand. Results: The RAC consisted of 46 proxy indicators (33 qualitative and 13 quantitative indicators) encompassing various aspects of GRESs. The GRES values or scores varied according to structural differences in the green roofs. The average score (from a maximum of 100) of total ecosystem services was 61 ± 7, which could be inferred as a good performance in ecosystem service provision. The highest scores were obtained from the regulating services at 68 ± 7. The lowest average score was 53 ± 11 from the provisioning services. Conclusions: The RAC was able to evaluate the levels of GRES provided by the selected green roofs, enabling the meaningful comparison of their potential capability to provide GRES.

This study revealed that methanolic extract showed the significant result in Kapoori, Sanchi and Meetha cultivars by in-vitro assays, hence authenticating the traditional claim of the plant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Environmental Technology and Innovation,"{'ISSN': '23521864', 'Source Type': 'Journal', 'Original Language': 'English'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.eti.2020.101140', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['Anti-diabetic', 'Anti-thrombin', 'Betelvine', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Piper betle', 'Cell culture', 'Enzyme inhibition', 'Gas chromatography', 'Lanthanum compounds', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Metabolites', 'Palmitic acid', 'Anticancer activities', 'Anticancer properties', 'Bioactive compounds', 'Bioactive substances', 'Comparative studies', 'Cytotoxicity effects', 'Methanolic extracts', 'Secondary metabolites', 'Plant extracts']","['aDepartment of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560 012, India', 'bDivision of Floriculture and Medicinal crops, ICAR, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Hessaraghatta Lake (PO), Bangalore, Karnataka  560 089, India', 'cDepartment of Chemical Technology, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': '', 'Funding Number': 'ICAR0013', 'Acronym': ''}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'University Grants Committee', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'UGC'}]"
Disappearing apple snails (Caenogastropoda: Ampullariidae) of Thailand: A comprehensive update of their taxonomic status and distribution(Article),"['Ng, T.H.', 'Annate, S.', 'Jeratthitikul, E.', 'Sutcharit, C.', 'Limpanont, Y.', 'Panha, S.']","Volume 86, Issue 4, 1 November 2020, Pages 290-305","Ampullariidae include the largest of all freshwater snails and are of ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic importance in Southeast Asia (SEA). Native ampullariids belonging to the genus Pila face various threats but are understudied, with their species taxonomy being confused and data on their distributions being scarce. We provide a comprehensive update on the nomenclature, status and distribution of Pila species in Thailand, based on DNA barcoding and geometric morphometric analysis of recently collected material. We confirm that at least five Pila species are extant in Thailand: Pila virescens, P. celebensis, P. turbinis, P. gracilis and P. pesmei. Pila celebensis, which has distinctive egg masses among all the known Southeast Asian Pila, appears to be sister to a clade comprising other SEA and some African Pila. Our results suggest that Pila may have dispersed into SEA on at least two separate occasions. Two singletons collected from northern and eastern Thailand may constitute separate species, but this requires further study. Intraspecific diversity of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene was relatively high for P. celebensis, P. gracilis and P. pesmei (maximum uncorrected p-distances varied from 7% to 9%), and may include cryptic species. Conversely, P. virescens showed low intraspecific p-distances (c. 0%) among clades collected from different localities. This strongly suggests that introductions by humans may be the major cause of this pattern, and our own observations-we found that this species is being cultured and is commonly sold in markets for human consumption-are consistent with this. Pila turbinis was the rarest species, with live snails being collected from only two localities. Throughout Thailand, invasive confamilial Pomacea species appear to be replacing native Pila species, particularly in the Chao Phraya basin. While Thai Pila exhibit surprisingly high genetic diversity, with cryptic species likely being present, widespread invasive snails pose a major threat to their survival and urgent conservation action is needed. © The Author(s) 2020.",Journal of Molluscan Studies,"{'ISSN': '02601230', 'Source Type': 'JMSTD', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1093/mollus/eyaa015', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['geographical distribution', 'marine environment', 'snail', 'taxonomy', 'Thailand', 'Ampullariidae', 'Basommatophora', 'Caenogastropoda', 'Gastropoda', 'Pomacea']","['aAnimal Systematics Research Unit, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bLee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, 2 Conservatory Drive, Singapore, 117377, Singapore', 'cAnimal Systematics and Molecular Ecology Laboratory, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand', 'dDepartment of Social and Environmental Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand']",[]

The effect of a flipped classroom with online group investigation on students' team learning ability(Article)(Open Access),"['Sojayapan, C.', 'Khlaisang, J.']","Volume 41, Issue 1, January-April 2020, Pages 28-33","This study examined the effects on the team learning ability of upper secondary school students using a flipped classroom model with online group investigation. The subjects of the study were 30 upper secondary school students. The instruments employed in the study consisted of: (1) a flipped classroom model with online group investigation, (2) a website for flipped classrooms, and (3) a learning management plan. The data collection instruments comprised: (1) a self-assessment form of team learning ability and (2) a team learning behaviour observation form. The study found that the average team learning ability of the learners was significantly higher after the lessons, and those with different learning abilities were able to learn as a team at significantly different rates. Post-hoc multiple comparison tests (LSD) revealed that the team learning ability scores of the learners with high learning ability differed significantly from those of the intermediate and beginner learning ability groups, while the team learning ability scores of the intermediate and the beginner groups were not significantly different. The beginner group scored the highest regarding team learning ability, followed by the intermediate group and the advanced group, respectively. © 2018 Kasetsart University.

Quantitation of phosphatidylserine-exposing platelets in platelet concentrate prepared in routine blood transfusion laboratory(Article)(Open Access),"['Noulsri, E.', 'Lerdwana, S.', 'Palasuwan, D.', 'Palasuwan, A.']","Volume 59, Issue 1, February 2020, Article number 102598","Background: Phosphatidylserine (PS) plays important roles in platelets’ pro-coagulant function. However, little is known about assessing this molecule in platelet concentrates (PCs) prepared for routine blood transfusion service. Aim: To quantitate the number of PS-exposing platelets in PCs prepared in a routine transfusion laboratory. Methods: PC products were prepared according to routine laboratory procedure. The numbers of PS-exposing platelets in the PCs and in unprocessed whole blood were determined using flow cytometry. Results: A cross-sectional study of 253 PCs found that they had significantly increased numbers of PS-exposing platelets compared to unprocessed whole blood (47,439 ± 26,500 cells/μL; 5903‒166,156 cells/μL) vs. 30,058 ± 12,958 cells/μL; 8,154-86,606 cells/μL). A heterogeneity study demonstrated that 6% and 2% of the measured PCs and of unprocessed donor whole blood, respectively, showed an increase in the number of PS-exposing platelets that was greater than 2 fold. Conclusions: The study suggested that the number PS-exposing platelets in PC prepared in a routine transfusion laboratory differs. However, assessment of the number of PS-exposing platelets in platelet products could be a valid measure to use in managing the quality of platelet processing in routine laboratories. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Transfusion and Apheresis Science,"{'ISSN': '14730502', 'Source Type': 'TASRC', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1016/j.transci.2019.06.025', 'Publisher': '31303511'}","['Flow cytometry', 'Laboratory', 'Phosphatidylserine', 'Platelet concentrate', 'Transfusion', 'phosphatidylserine', 'thrombocyte concentrate', 'phosphatidylserine', 'Article', 'blood donor', 'blood sampling', 'blood transfusion', 'cross-sectional study', 'flow cytometry', 'human', 'human cell', 'platelet count', 'thrombocyte', 'blood transfusion', 'laboratory', 'metabolism', 'procedures', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Laboratories', 'Phosphatidylserines']","['aResearch Division, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand', 'bDepartment of Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand', 'cOxidation in Red Cell Disorders and Health Task Force, Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand']","[{'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': 'CU-GES-60-05-30-01', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': 'CU'}, {'Funding Sponsor': 'Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University', 'Funding Number': '', 'Acronym': ''}]"
GaAsPBi epitaxial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy(Article),"['Himwas, C.', 'Soison, A.', 'Kijamnajsuk, S.', 'Wongpinij, T.', 'Euaraksakul, C.', 'Panyakeow, S.', 'Kanjanachuchai, S.']","Volume 35, Issue 9, September 2020, Article number 095009","GaAsPBi is a new class of quaternary III-V compounds that extends the concept of band gap engineering on GaAs with potentials for lattice matching and excellent temperature stability. The alloy has so far been grown only by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy and this work represents the first epitaxial results of the alloy grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), an alternative technique and better suited for low-temperature processes involving Bismuth. Crystalline quality of the alloys is probed by high-resolution x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) which show that smooth and optically active films can be grown in limited parameter windows. Temperature-dependent PL shows that the 200 nm, MBE-grown GaAs0.38P0.44Bi0.18 film (the composition estimated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) has a band gap temperature stability close to that of GaAsBi, and superior to GaAs. The role of Bi in the quaternary alloy is complicated: Bi not only gets incorporated into the growing film but also enhances the P molar fraction. Based on this insight, strategies for growing GaAsPBi epilayers which are lattice-matched to GaAs are described, potentially affecting many important III-V based heterostructures such as lasers, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Semiconductor Science and Technology,"{'ISSN': '02681242', 'Source Type': 'SSTEE', 'Original Language': 'Journal'}","{'Document Type': '10.1088/1361-6641/ab9b38', 'Publisher': 'Article'}","['bismuth compound', 'III-V material', 'molecular beam epitaxy', 'Energy gap', 'Gallium arsenide', 'III-V semiconductors', 'Metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy', 'Molecular beam epitaxy', 'Molecular beams', 'Semiconducting gallium', 'Semiconductor quantum wells', 'Temperature', 'X ray diffraction analysis', 'X ray photoelectron spectroscopy', 'Band gap engineering', 'Crystalline quality', 'High resolution X ray diffraction', 'Lattice matching', 'Low- temperature process', 'Quaternary alloys', 'Temperature dependent', 'Temperature stability', 'Bismuth alloys']","['aSemiconductor Device Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phayathai Road, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand', 'bNational Metal and Materials Technology Center, Thailand Science Park, 114 Paholyothin Rd., Klong 1, Klong Luang, Pathumthani, 12120, Thailand', 'cSynchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization), Ministry of Science and Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, 30000, Thailand']",[]
Kick-starting ovarian cyclicity by using dietary glucogenic precursors in post-partum dairy cows: a review(Review)(Open Access),"['Kaewlamun, W.', 'Grimard, B.', 'Duvaux-Ponter, C.', 'Ponter, A.A.']","Volume 8, Issue 1, 1 January 2020, Pages 39-48","The objective of this review is to describe how dietary glucogenic precursors could stimulate ovarian activity in post-partum dairy cows and improve reproductive success. Although the nutrient requirements for the early resumption of ovarian cycles, and for follicle and embryo development are quantitatively small, reproductive success is deteriorated by post-partum negative energy balance. Since very little glucose is absorbed directly from the digestive tract of ruminants one of the targets for nutritional manipulation could be the glucogenic potential of the diet. This could be achieved by giving rumen-resistant starch or mono-propylene glycol. Both these adaptations increase glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 plasma concentrations and stimulate ovarian follicle growth. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).
